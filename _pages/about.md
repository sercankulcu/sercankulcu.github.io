Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Sercan Külcü, and I am a lecturer of computer science at Giresun University. I have a strong interest in computer networks and embedded systems, and I am always seeking new ways to apply my skills and knowledge to solve challenging problems in these areas. Also, I am a hands-on software engineer since 2005, and hold a PhD degree in wireless communication.

My research interests include low-power wireless communication (such as 6TiSCH, LoRaWAN, and Bluetooth Low-Energy), embedded and real-time operating systems (such as ContikiOS, RIOT, and TinyOS), machine learning applications (using tools like WEKA, TensorFlow, and Apache Mahout), and C/C++ programming. I am also interested in exploring the applications of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and its integration with existing technologies.

In addition to my work as a researcher and lecturer, I have also been teaching OOP and Java courses since 2015. I have experience teaching a variety of topics related to software engineering, including object-oriented programming, design patterns, data structures and algorithms.

On this website, you will find information about my research and teaching activities, as well as my publications and other professional works. I am also available for consulting services in the areas of computer networks and embedded systems, so please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.

Thanks for visiting my website!
