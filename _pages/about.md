Hello..

<img align="right" width="150" height="150" alt="owl coffee beans" src="/images/owl-coffee-bean.png">

Welcome to my personal website. My name is Sercan K端lc端, and I am an assistant professor in computer science at Giresun University. I am interested in computer networks and embedded systems, and I am always looking for new ways to apply my skills and knowledge to solve challenging problems in these areas. I am also a hands-on software engineer since 2005 and have a PhD in wireless communications.

My research interests include low-power wireless communications (e.g., 6TiSCH, LoRaWAN, and Bluetooth Low-Energy), embedded and real-time operating systems (e.g., ContikiOS, RIOT, and TinyOS), machine learning applications (using tools such as WEKA, TensorFlow, and Apache Mahout), and C/C++ programming. I am also interested in Internet of Things (IoT) applications and its integration with existing technologies.

In addition to my work as a researcher and lecturer, I have also been teaching OOP and Java courses since 2015. I have experience teaching a variety of topics related to software engineering, including object-oriented programming, design patterns, data structures, and algorithms.

On this website, you will find information about my research and teaching activities, as well as my publications and other professional work. I am also available for consulting services in the areas of computer networks and embedded systems. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.

Thank you for visiting my website!
