Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Sercan Külcü, and I am a lecturer of computer science at Giresun University. I have a strong interest in computer networks and embedded systems, and I am always seeking new ways to apply my skills and knowledge to solve challenging problems in these areas. Also, I am a hands-on software engineer since 2005, and hold a PhD degree in wireless communication.

My research interests include low-power wireless communication (such as 6TiSCH, LoRaWAN, and Bluetooth Low-Energy), embedded and real-time operating systems (such as ContikiOS, RIOT, and TinyOS), machine learning applications (using tools like WEKA, TensorFlow, and Apache Mahout), and C/C++ programming. I have a wealth of experience and knowledge in these areas, and I am always looking for new ways to share my expertise with others.

In addition to my work as a researcher and lecturer, I have also been teaching OOP and Java courses since 2015. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others and helping them to develop their skills and expertise in the field of computer science.

Thank you for visiting my personal website. I hope you will find the information and resources here to be useful, and I encourage you to get in touch if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work.
