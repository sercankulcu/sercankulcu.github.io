<p>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Sercan Külcü, and I am a lecturer in computer science at Giresun University. I am very interested in computer networks and embedded systems, and I am always looking for new ways to apply my skills and knowledge to solve challenging problems in these areas. I am also a hands-on software engineer since 2005 and have a PhD in wireless communications.</p>

<p>My research interests include low-power wireless communications (e.g., 6TiSCH, LoRaWAN, and Bluetooth Low-Energy), embedded and real-time operating systems (e.g., ContikiOS, RIOT, and TinyOS), machine learning applications (using tools such as WEKA, TensorFlow, and Apache Mahout), and C/C++ programming. I am also interested in Internet of Things (IoT) applications and its integration with existing technologies.</p>

<p>In addition to my work as a researcher and lecturer, I have also been teaching OOP and Java courses since 2015. I have experience teaching a variety of topics related to software engineering, including object-oriented programming, design patterns, data structures, and algorithms.</p>

<p>On this website, you will find information about my research and teaching activities, as well as my publications and other professional work. I am also available for consulting services in the areas of computer networks and embedded systems. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or inquiries.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
