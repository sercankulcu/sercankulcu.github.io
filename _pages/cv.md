With 20+ years of experience and a PhD in wireless communication, I specialize in low-power wireless communication, embedded systems, real-time OS, C/C++ programming, and machine learning. Since 2015, I have also taught Object-Oriented Programming and Java courses.

## Education

### <img src="/images/logo-ktu.png" alt="KTU" width="50" height="50"> Ph.D in Computer Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, 2022
  I developed a simulation framework using the Cooja simulator, incorporating the Steerable Smart Antennas model, the 6TiSCH Protocol, and a traffic generator. I evaluated the model's performance by analyzing network throughput, energy consumption, reliability, and metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and network lifetime. Additionally, I conducted research on applying computer vision to food science, creating algorithms in Python and OpenCV for processing and analyzing food images. I designed a system for detecting and classifying food items based on visual characteristics like color, texture, and shape.

  I developed a web-based dictionary platform inspired by the Turkish platform Eksisozluk, using PHP and MySQL. I designed the database architecture to efficiently store and retrieve user-generated content. Additionally, I built a sentiment analysis tool for social media, utilizing Python and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment and topics of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. I also created a social network analysis tool using semantic web and big data technologies, designing a scalable architecture that included data ingestion, modeling, querying, analysis, and visualization layers.

### <img src="/images/logo-hacettepe.png" alt="Hacettepe" width="50" height="50"> B.S. in Computer Engineering, Hacettepe University, 2006
  I developed a Tetris game using assembly language and interrupts for random number generation and keyboard interaction, designed to run on an x86 PC platform. Additionally, I created a file system utilizing the B+ tree data structure in C++ for efficient file storage, retrieval, allocation, deletion, and searching. I also built a Java Swing-based chat application with a client-server architecture using sockets, enabling local network communication through a user-friendly GUI. Furthermore, I developed an image processing application using computer vision techniques to detect license plates and estimate the speed of moving vehicles.

## Work experience

### <img src="/images/logo-giresun.png" alt="GRU" width="50" height="50"> 2023-Present: Assistant Professor, Giresun University
  I teach and develop course materials for Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Introduction to Programming using Java, combining lectures with hands-on tutorials and lab sessions to ensure students grasp both theory and practice. I also evaluate their progress through exams and assignments, offering constructive feedback to support their learning.

### <img src="/images/logo-giresun.png" alt="GRU" width="50" height="50"> 2015-2023: Teaching Assistant, Giresun University
  I have taught and developed course materials for Object-Oriented Programming in Java, as well as Professional Math and Professional English. My responsibilities included leading tutorials and lab sessions to reinforce understanding, evaluating student performance through exams and assignments, and providing constructive feedback to support their academic growth.

### <img src="/images/logo-sdt.png" alt="SDT" width="75" height="40"> 2011-2015: Leader Software Engineer, SDT Space and Defence Technologies 
  I contributed to the development of digital data recorder projects leveraging real-time Linux distributions. My role involved integrating software with diverse data buses such as MIL-STD-1553B, ARINC429, CAN, and Ethernet. Additionally, I customized and optimized Linux kernels to meet project-specific requirements, ensuring performance and functionality.

### <img src="/images/logo-sdt.png" alt="SDT" width="75" height="40"> 2008-2011: Senior Software Engineer, SDT Space and Defence Technologies 
  I contributed to the development of embedded simulation software using VxWorks, conducting in-depth research on guidance and control systems to ensure simulation accuracy and reliability. This included modeling missile systems with a focus on simulation, guidance, and control, applying advanced mathematical techniques for precision. Additionally, I designed and implemented embedded system software using C and C++.

### <img src="/images/logo-sdt.png" alt="SDT" width="75" height="40"> 2005-2008: Software Engineer, SDT Space and Defence Technologies 
  I collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement tactical environment simulation software tailored to client requirements. My responsibilities included developing software for the Linux operating system, integrating it with protocols such as High-Level Architecture (HLA) and Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). I also established testing procedures to ensure quality and reliability and actively participated in all stages of the software development lifecycle, from planning to maintenance.
