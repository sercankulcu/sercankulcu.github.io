# Sercan Kulcu's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the **Sercan Kulcu's Personal Portfolio** repository! This is a GitHub Pages website showcasing my projects, skills, and professional background. The site is live at [https://sercankulcu.github.io](https://sercankulcu.github.io) and serves as a central hub to explore my work in software development and computer science.

## Overview

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, highlighting my programming projects, technical skills, and contact information. It is deployed automatically via GitHub Pages, making it accessible to anyone interested in my work.

## Features

The website includes the following sections:

- **About**: An introduction to who I am, my background, and my interests in software development.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my programming projects, including data structures, algorithms, and other repositories available on my GitHub profile.
- **Skills**: A list of technical skills, such as Java, object-oriented programming, and algorithm design.
- **Contact**: Ways to get in touch, including email and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
- **Resume**: A downloadable or viewable version of my professional resume (if applicable).
