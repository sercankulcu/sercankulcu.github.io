Algorithmic Game Theory is an interdisciplinary field that blends the mathematical rigor of game theory with the practical, problem-solving techniques of computer science. This area of study focuses on designing and analyzing algorithms for solving games and game-like scenarios, where multiple players with potentially conflicting interests interact. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including the computation of equilibria, the efficiency and fairness of various algorithmic mechanisms, and the strategic behavior of rational agents in competitive environments. By leveraging computational methods, algorithmic game theory provides valuable insights into complex systems, from economic markets to networked environments, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical foundations and real-world applications.

## Chapter 1: Game Theory Fundamentals

Game theory is a mathematical framework used to analyze and understand strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. It provides a systematic way of studying situations where the outcome of one person's decision depends on the actions of others.

## Chapter 3: Nash Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior

Nash equilibrium is a central concept in game theory that captures the notion of strategic behavior and stable outcomes in games. It refers to a set of strategies, one for each player, where no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their chosen strategy, assuming all other players stick to their strategies.

## Chapter 6: Social Choice and Voting Systems

Social choice theory is a branch of economics and political science that studies methods for aggregating individual preferences or opinions into a collective choice. It explores the challenges and possibilities of making decisions on behalf of a group or society based on the preferences of its members. Voting systems are one of the key tools analyzed in social choice theory.
