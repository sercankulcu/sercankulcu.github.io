<img align="left" width="200" alt="algorithmic game theory" src="/images/teaching/algorithmic-game-theory-course.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"> Algorithmic Game Theory is an interdisciplinary field that blends the mathematical rigor of game theory with the practical, problem-solving techniques of computer science. This area of study focuses on designing and analyzing algorithms for solving games and game-like scenarios, where multiple players with potentially conflicting interests interact. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including the computation of equilibria, the efficiency and fairness of various algorithmic mechanisms, and the strategic behavior of rational agents in competitive environments. By leveraging computational methods, algorithmic game theory provides valuable insights into complex systems, from economic markets to networked environments, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical foundations and real-world applications.

Chapter 1: Game Theory Fundamentals
-----

Game theory is a mathematical framework used to analyze and understand strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. It provides a systematic way of studying situations where the outcome of one person's decision depends on the actions of others.

Chapter 2: Introduction to Algorithmic Game Theory 
-----

Algorithmic game theory is an interdisciplinary field that combines concepts from game theory and computer science. It focuses on the study of strategic interactions in computational settings and aims to design efficient algorithms and computational models for analyzing and solving games.

Chapter 3: Nash Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior
-----

Nash equilibrium is a central concept in game theory that captures the notion of strategic behavior and stable outcomes in games. It refers to a set of strategies, one for each player, where no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their chosen strategy, assuming all other players stick to their strategies.

* Code Examples <a href="https://github.com/sercankulcu/agt/tree/main/Chapter">[link]</a>

Chapter 4: Mechanism Design and Incentives
-----

Mechanism design is a field of study within game theory and economics that focuses on designing rules or mechanisms to achieve desired outcomes in strategic settings. It involves designing incentive-compatible mechanisms that align the self-interests of individual participants with the desired collective goals.

* Code Examples <a href="https://github.com/sercankulcu/agt/tree/main/Chapter">[link]</a>

Chapter 5: Auctions and Market Design
-----

Auctions and market design are closely related fields that utilize principles from economics, game theory, and mechanism design to study the allocation of goods, resources, and services in various settings. Both areas aim to create efficient and fair mechanisms for matching buyers and sellers, determining prices, and optimizing resource allocation.

Chapter 6: Social Choice and Voting Systems
-----

Social choice theory is a branch of economics and political science that studies methods for aggregating individual preferences or opinions into a collective choice. It explores the challenges and possibilities of making decisions on behalf of a group or society based on the preferences of its members. Voting systems are one of the key tools analyzed in social choice theory.

Chapter 7: Algorithmic Fairness and Ethics
-----

Algorithmic fairness and ethics play a crucial role in algorithmic game theory by addressing the potential biases, discrimination, and ethical implications that may arise in the design and deployment of algorithms within game-theoretic frameworks.

Chapter 8: Network Design and Routing
-----

In algorithmic game theory, network design and routing are studied with a focus on understanding the strategic behavior of self-interested agents and optimizing network efficiency and fairness.

Chapter 9: Price of Anarchy and Efficiency
-----

Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a measure that quantifies the loss of efficiency in a system due to the selfish behavior of individual agents. It evaluates the impact of strategic decision-making on the overall performance or welfare of a system.
