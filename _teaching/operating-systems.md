Operating systems are an essential part of modern computing, serving as the foundation of any computer system. They are responsible for managing the hardware and software resources of a computer and providing a platform for other programs to run on. An operating system acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the software applications that users interact with, providing a uniform interface that applications can use to communicate with the hardware. Without an operating system, a computer would be nothing more than a collection of hardware components that could not be easily controlled or utilized by users.
