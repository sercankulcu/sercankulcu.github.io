        <h2>Question 1</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Find the smallest value of \( n \) for which an algorithm with a runtime of \( 10^4 n^2 \) runs faster than an algorithm with a runtime of \( 2^n \) on the same computer.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to find the smallest integer n such that an algorithm with running time 10^4 n^2 is faster than one with 2^n. This translates to solving:</p>
        <p class="math">10,000 n^2 < 2^n</p>
        <p>Since 10^4 = 10,000, we compare 10,000 n^2 against 2^n. Exponential functions grow faster than polynomials, so we expect 10,000 n^2 to be smaller than 2^n for sufficiently large n.</p>
        <p>Let's test integer values to find the crossover point:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For n = 20: 10,000 * 20^2 = 10,000 * 400 = 4,000,000; 2^20 = 1,048,576. Since 4,000,000 > 1,048,576, not yet.</li>
            <li>For n = 22: 10,000 * 22^2 = 10,000 * 484 = 4,840,000; 2^22 = 4,194,304. Still 4,840,000 > 4,194,304.</li>
            <li>For n = 23: 10,000 * 23^2 = 10,000 * 529 = 5,290,000; 2^23 = 8,388,608. Now 5,290,000 < 8,388,608.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To confirm, consider n = 21: 10,000 * 21^2 = 10,000 * 441 = 4,410,000; 2^21 = 2,097,152. Here, 4,410,000 > 2,097,152.</p>
        <p>For precision, solve 10,000 n^2 = 2^n numerically:</p>
        <p class="math">ln(10,000 n^2) = ln(2^n)</p>
        <p class="math">ln(10,000) + 2 ln(n) = n ln(2)</p>
        <p>With ln(10,000) ≈ 9.21034, ln(2) ≈ 0.693147, we get:</p>
        <p class="math">9.21034 + 2 ln(n) = 0.693147 n</p>
        <p>Testing n = 22: 2 ln(22) ≈ 6.18208, 0.693147 * 22 ≈ 15.24923, so 9.21034 + 6.18208 - 15.24923 ≈ 0.14319 (positive).</p>
        <p>Testing n = 23: 2 ln(23) ≈ 6.27098, 0.693147 * 23 ≈ 15.94238, so 9.21034 + 6.27098 - 15.94238 ≈ -0.46106 (negative).</p>
        <p>The crossover occurs between 22 and 23, so n = 23 is the smallest integer where 10,000 n^2 < 2^n.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 23</p>

        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> A sorting algorithm works as follows: The algorithm takes an input array of n elements (let this array be D[1..n]), finds the largest element, and swaps it with the element at D[1]. Then, it finds the largest element among the remaining n-1 elements and swaps it with the element at D[2]. The algorithm continues this process, sorting all elements in the array in descending order.</p>
        <p>a. Write this algorithm in pseudo-code.</p>
		<p>b. Calculate the algorithm's runtime in the best, average, and worst cases.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>This describes the Selection Sort algorithm, adapted to sort in descending order. Let's address both parts.</p>
        <h4>Part a: Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>The algorithm repeatedly finds the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion.</p>
        <pre><code>
ALGORITHM SelectionSortDescending(D[1..n])
    FOR i = 1 TO n
        max_index = i
        FOR j = i + 1 TO n
            IF D[j] > D[max_index]
                max_index = j
            END IF
        END FOR
        IF max_index != i
            SWAP D[i], D[max_index]
        END IF
    END FOR
END ALGORITHM
        </code></pre>
        <h4>Part b: Running Time Analysis</h4>
        <p>Let's analyze the time complexity in best, average, and worst cases.</p>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outer loop runs n times (i = 1 to n).</li>
            <li>Inner loop for finding max runs from j = i + 1 to n, i.e., (n - i) iterations.</li>
            <li>Each inner loop iteration performs a comparison (D[j] > D[max_index]).</li>
            <li>A swap occurs if max_index != i (constant time).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Number of Comparisons:</strong></p>
        <p>For i = 1: (n - 1) comparisons.</p>
        <p>For i = 2: (n - 2) comparisons.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>For i = n: 0 comparisons.</p>
        <p>Total comparisons:</p>
        <p class="math">(n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1 + 0 = n(n - 1)/2</p>
        <p>This is approximately n^2 / 2 comparisons.</p>
        <p><strong>Swaps:</strong> At most one swap per i, so at most n swaps (O(n)).</p>
        <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> The array is in ascending order (smallest to largest), requiring the maximum to be found and swapped each time. Comparisons dominate: O(n^2).</li>
            <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> The array is already in descending order (largest to smallest). The inner loop still checks all elements to confirm the max, so comparisons remain n(n - 1)/2. Thus, O(n^2).</li>
            <li><strong>Average Case:</strong> For a random permutation, the max is found after scanning the unsorted portion, averaging n(n - 1)/2 comparisons. Still O(n^2).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since comparisons dominate and are the same in all cases, the time complexity is:</p>
        <p class="math">T(n) = Theta(n^2)</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>a. Pseudocode as shown above.</p>
        <p>b. Best case: Theta(n^2), Average case: Theta(n^2), Worst case: Theta(n^2).</p>

        <h2>Question 3</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Given an array D[1..n] of n integers and an integer x, design an algorithm with a runtime of Theta(n log n) that determines whether there exist any two elements in the array whose sum is exactly x.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need an algorithm that checks if there exist two elements in array D[1..n] whose sum equals x, with a time complexity of Theta(n log n).</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Sort the array (which takes Theta(n log n)) and then use a two-pointer technique to find a pair summing to x in O(n) time, keeping the overall complexity at Theta(n log n).</p>
        <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sort the array D[1..n] in ascending order.</li>
            <li>Initialize two pointers: left = 1, right = n.</li>
            <li>While left < right:
                <ul>
                    <li>Compute sum = D[left] + D[right].</li>
                    <li>If sum == x, return true (pair found).</li>
                    <li>If sum < x, increment left to increase the sum.</li>
                    <li>If sum > x, decrement right to decrease the sum.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If no pair is found, return false.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>
ALGORITHM FindPairSum(D[1..n], x)
    Sort(D) // Using an efficient sorting algorithm like MergeSort
    left = 1
    right = n
    WHILE left < right
        sum = D[left] + D[right]
        IF sum == x
            RETURN true
        ELSE IF sum < x
            left = left + 1
        ELSE // sum > x
            right = right - 1
        END IF
    END WHILE
    RETURN false
END ALGORITHM
        </code></pre>
        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong></p>
        <p>Sorting ensures D is in ascending order. The two-pointer technique works because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If D[left] + D[right] = x, we've found a pair.</li>
            <li>If the sum is too small, we need a larger number, so increment left.</li>
            <li>If the sum is too large, we need a smaller number, so decrement right.</li>
            <li>Since left < right, we avoid counting the same element twice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The algorithm checks all possible pairs that could sum to x in sorted order, missing no valid pairs.</p>
        <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting: Theta(n log n) using MergeSort or HeapSort.</li>
            <li>Two-pointer scan: Each pointer moves at most n times, and left + right decreases each step, so O(n).</li>
            <li>Total: Theta(n log n) + O(n) = Theta(n log n).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The algorithm above solves the problem in Theta(n log n) time.</p>

        <h2>Question 4</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Design an algorithm with a runtime of Theta(n log k) that merges k sorted arrays into a single sorted array, where n is the total number of elements across all arrays. Discuss the correctness of your algorithm and analyze its runtime.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to merge k sorted arrays into one sorted array, with a total of n elements, in Theta(n log k) time. A min-heap is ideal for this, as it allows us to repeatedly extract the smallest element efficiently.</p>
        <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a min-heap.</li>
            <li>Insert the first element of each of the k arrays into the min-heap, along with its array index and element index (to track its origin).</li>
            <li>While the heap is not empty:
                <ul>
                    <li>Extract the minimum element from the heap.</li>
                    <li>Add it to the output array.</li>
                    <li>If the extracted element's array has more elements, insert the next element from that array into the heap.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>
ALGORITHM MergeKSortedArrays(arrays[1..k], sizes[1..k])
    // arrays[i] is the i-th sorted array, sizes[i] is its length

END ALGORITHM
        </code></pre>
        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong></p>
        <p>The min-heap always contains the smallest unprocessed element from each array. Extracting the minimum ensures elements are added to the output in sorted order. For each extracted element, we insert the next element from its array (if any), maintaining the invariant that the heap contains the next candidate from each non-empty array. Since each array is sorted, the next element from an array is at least as large as the extracted one, ensuring the output is sorted. All n elements are processed exactly once, so the output contains all elements in sorted order.</p>
        <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heap Initialization:</strong> Insert first element from each of k arrays. Each insertion is O(log k), so k insertions take O(k log k).</li>
            <li><strong>Main Loop:</strong> We perform n extract-min operations (one per element), each O(log k). For each extraction, we may insert one element, also O(log k). Total: n extract-min (O(n log k)) + n insertions (O(n log k)) = O(n log k).</li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> O(k log k) + O(n log k). Since k ≤ n (each array has at least one element), O(k log k) is absorbed by O(n log k), giving Theta(n log k).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(k) for the heap, O(n) for the output array.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The min-heap-based algorithm merges k sorted arrays in Theta(n log k) time, as shown above.</p>

        <h2>Question 5</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> In a sports tournament, there are a total of n athletes. A match may or may not occur between any two athletes. If a match occurs between two athletes, one is assigned to team A and the other to team B. Given that the total number of matches in the tournament is m, is it possible to classify all athletes in O(n + m) time, assigning some to team A and the rest to team B, with the constraint that every match must only occur between an athlete from team A and an athlete from team B (i.e., two athletes from team A cannot compete against each other)? Explain your answer.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>This problem asks whether we can partition n athletes into two teams, A and B, such that all m matches (edges) occur between an athlete in A and an athlete in B, in O(n + m) time. This is equivalent to determining if the graph of athletes (vertices) and matches (edges) is bipartite.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be colored with two colors (e.g., A and B) such that no edge connects vertices of the same color. We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to assign colors and check for conflicts, which runs in O(n + m) time for a graph with n vertices and m edges.</p>
        <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Represent the tournament as an undirected graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of n athletes, and E is the set of m matches.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Initialize an array team[1..n] to track assignments (-1 for unassigned, 0 for A, 1 for B).</li>
                <li>For each unassigned athlete, start a BFS, assigning them to team A (0).</li>
                <li>For each neighbor, assign the opposite team. If a neighbor is already assigned to the same team, the graph is not bipartite, so return false.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If BFS completes without conflicts, the graph is bipartite, and the team assignments are valid.</li>

        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong></p>
        <p>A graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd-length cycles. BFS assigns alternating teams (A, B) to adjacent vertices. If we encounter a vertex that should have opposite teams but doesn't, it indicates a conflict (e.g., an odd cycle), meaning the graph isn't bipartite. If BFS completes without conflicts, the assignments satisfy the condition that all edges (matches) are between A and B.</p>
        <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Graph Construction:</strong> Building the adjacency list from m edges takes O(m) time.</li>
            <li><strong>BFS:</strong> Each vertex is enqueued at most once (O(n)), and each edge is processed at most twice (once per endpoint), so O(m). Total BFS time is O(n + m).</li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> O(n + m) for construction and BFS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n) for the team array and queue, O(m) for the adjacency list.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Yes, it is possible to classify the athletes into teams A and B in O(n + m) time by checking if the graph is bipartite using BFS.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, it is possible in O(n + m) time using the bipartite graph algorithm above.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Modify the Depth First Search algorithm to assign each node the number of the connected component it belongs to. In other words, adjust the Depth First Search algorithm so that any two nodes in the same component receive the same component number, and nodes in different components receive different component numbers.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to modify the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to assign a unique component number to each vertex in an undirected graph, such that vertices in the same connected component have the same number, and those in different components have different numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Run DFS on the graph, incrementing a component counter each time we start a new DFS from an unvisited vertex. Assign the current component number to all vertices reached during that DFS.</p>

        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong> DFS explores all vertices reachable from a starting vertex, forming a connected component. Assigning the same component number during one DFS ensures all vertices in that component get the same number.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to determine if an undirected graph G contains a cycle, with a time complexity linear in the number of vertices (V) and edges (E), i.e., O(V + E).</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Use DFS to detect a cycle. A cycle exists if, during DFS, we encounter a visited vertex that is not the parent of the current vertex (a back edge). To handle disconnected components, run DFS from each unvisited vertex.</p>

        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong> In an undirected graph, a cycle exists if DFS finds a back edge (an edge to a visited vertex other than the parent).

        <h2>Question 3</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> How do the strongly connected components of a graph change when a new edge is added to the graph? Explain your answer.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to analyze how adding an edge to a directed graph affects its strongly connected components (SCCs). An SCC is a subset of vertices where there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the subset, and no additional vertices can be included without breaking this property.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
        <p>Let the graph be G = (V, E), and suppose we add edge (u, v). SCCs are defined based on mutual reachability. Adding an edge can only increase reachability, so existing SCCs cannot split, but they may merge or remain unchanged.</p>
        <p><strong>Possible Effects:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Change:</strong> If u and v are already in the same SCC, adding (u, v) doesn't change reachability, as there was already a path from u to v (and vice versa within the SCC). The SCCs remain unchanged.</li>
            <li><strong>Merging SCCs:</strong> If u is in SCC1 and v is in SCC2 (distinct SCCs), adding (u, v) creates a new path from u to v. We need to check if this causes SCC1 and SCC2 to merge, which depends on whether there is now a path from v to u:
                <ul>
                    <li>If a path from v to u exists in G (possibly through other SCCs), then all vertices in SCC1 and SCC2 (and any SCCs on paths between them) become mutually reachable, merging into a single SCC.</li>
                    <li>If no path from v to u exists, the SCCs remain separate, as mutual reachability isn't achieved.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Intermediate SCCs:</strong> If (u, v) connects SCCs in a way that affects paths through other SCCs (e.g., SCC3 lies on a path from v to u), those SCCs may also merge with SCC1 and SCC2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graph with two SCCs: {1, 2} (1->2, 2->1) and {3, 4} (3->4, 4->3). Add edge (2, 3). Check if there's a path from 3 to 2. If 3->4->3 exists but no path to 2, SCCs remain separate. If a path 3->4->2 exists, {1, 2, 3, 4} may form one SCC.</li>
            <li>If u, v in same SCC, e.g., add (1, 2) to {1, 2}, no change occurs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Adding an edge (u, v) either leaves SCCs unchanged (if u, v are in the same SCC) or may merge the SCCs containing u and v (and possibly others) if adding (u, v) creates mutual reachability between them, determined by checking for a path from v to u in the original graph.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Adding an edge (u, v) either keeps SCCs unchanged (if u, v are in the same SCC) or merges the SCCs of u and v (and possibly intermediate SCCs) if a path from v to u exists, increasing mutual reachability.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>A directed graph is weakly connected if, for every pair of vertices u and v, there is a path from u to v or from v to u (ignoring edge directions for connectivity). We need an algorithm to check this in O(V + E) time.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> A directed graph is weakly connected if its underlying undirected graph (where edges are treated as bidirectional) has exactly one connected component. We can use DFS or BFS to count the number of connected components in the undirected version of the graph.</p>

        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong> A graph is weakly connected if ignoring edge directions results in one connected component. DFS from any vertex in the undirected graph visits all vertices in its component. If all vertices are visited, there is only one component, so G is weakly connected. If any vertex remains unvisited, there are multiple components, and G is not weakly connected. The algorithm correctly checks this by exploring the undirected graph.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to count the number of distinct paths from vertex s to vertex t in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A DAG has no cycles, so paths are finite, and we can use dynamic programming (DP) for efficiency.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Since the graph is acyclic, we can process vertices in topological order. For each vertex u, compute the number of paths from s to u, culminating at t. Use DP where dp[u] represents the number of paths from s to u.</p>

        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong> In a DAG, all paths from s to t pass through vertices in topological order. For vertex v, dp[v] counts paths from s to v by summing paths to its predecessors u (dp[u]), each extended by edge (u, v). Since s precedes all vertices in paths from s, dp[s] = 1 initializes correctly. Processing in topological order ensures dp[u] is computed before its successors, avoiding uncomputed dependencies.

            <li>Relax all edges from u: for each neighbor v, update distance[v] = min(distance[v], distance[u] + w(u, v)).</li>
            <li>Mark u as finalized.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why It Fails with Negative Weights:</strong></p>
        <p>Dijkstra’s assumes that once a vertex’s distance is minimized and finalized, it cannot be reduced further. This holds for non-negative weights because adding edges (with weight ≥ 0) cannot decrease a path’s total weight. However, with negative weights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A vertex u may be finalized with distance d[u], but a later path through a negative-weight edge (e.g., w(v, u) < 0) could reduce d[u].</li>
            <li>Dijkstra’s does not revisit finalized vertices, so it misses these shorter paths.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Graph with vertices {s, a, b}, edges: (s, a, 5), (s, b, 10), (a, b, -8).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dijkstra’s from s:
                <ul>
                    <li>Finalize s: d[s] = 0, d[a] = 5, d[b] = 10.</li>
                    <li>Finalize a (min 5): d[b] = min(10, 5 + (-8)) = -3, but b’s distance isn’t updated in queue.</li>
                    <li>Finalize b with d[b] = 10 (incorrect).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Actual shortest path to b: s->a->b = 5 + (-8) = -3.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Reason:</strong> Negative weights violate the greedy property: a shorter path may be found after a vertex is finalized, but Dijkstra’s assumes finalized distances are optimal.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Dijkstra’s fails with negative weights because it finalizes vertices assuming their distances cannot decrease, but negative edges can reduce distances later, and the algorithm does not revisit finalized vertices.</p>

        <h2>Question 4</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Let the edge with the minimum weight in a graph be e=(u, v). Prove that this edge is included in the graph's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), or provide a simple example showing that it may not be included. (You may assume there is only one edge with the minimum weight.)</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to either prove that the minimum-weight edge in a graph is always in its Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or provide a counterexample to show it may not be. The problem allows assuming the minimum weight is unique.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof Attempt:</strong> Let G = (V, E) be a connected undirected graph, and let e = (u, v) be the unique minimum-weight edge with weight w(e). An MST is a tree with |V| - 1 edges that minimizes total weight.</p>
        <p>Suppose e is not in some MST T. Since T is a tree, there is a unique path P in T between u and v. Adding e to T forms a cycle C = P + e. For C to be a cycle, P must have at least one edge. Let f be an edge in P with weight w(f). Since e has the minimum weight, w(e) < w(f) (due to uniqueness).</p>
        <p>Construct T' = T - f + e (remove f, add e). T' is still connected (since removing f from P disconnects u and v, but e reconnects them) and has |V| - 1 edges, so T' is a spanning tree. The weight of T' is:</p>
        <p class="math">w(T') = w(T) - w(f) + w(e)</p>
        <p>Since w(e) < w(f), w(T') < w(T). This contradicts T being an MST, as T' has lower weight.</p>
        <p>Thus, any MST must include e, or a lower-weight spanning tree exists, which is impossible.</p>
        <p><strong>Counterexample Check:</strong> Could e be excluded? Consider a cycle with e as the lightest edge, e.g., vertices {a, b, c}, edges: (a, b, 1), (b, c, 2), (c, a, 2). MST is any two edges, e.g., {(a, b, 1), (b, c, 2)}. Excluding (a, b) requires both (b, c, 2) and (c, a, 2), which isn’t a tree. In all connected graphs, excluding e increases weight or breaks the tree property.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The minimum-weight edge is always in the MST.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The minimum-weight edge e=(u, v) is always in the MST, as excluding it leads to a spanning tree with higher weight, contradicting the MST’s minimality.</p>

        <h2>Question 5</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> How many distinct Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) does a graph with distinct edge weights have? Explain your answer.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to determine how many distinct Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) a graph with distinct edge weights has.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> In a graph with distinct edge weights, Kruskal’s or Prim’s algorithm produces an MST by always choosing the smallest available edge that doesn’t form a cycle (Kruskal’s) or extends the current tree (Prim’s).</p>
        <p><strong>Claim:</strong> If all edge weights are distinct, the MST is unique.</p>
        <p><strong>Proof:</strong> Suppose G = (V, E) has distinct edge weights, and there are two MSTs, T1 and T2, with weight W. Since T1 ≠ T2, there exists an edge e in T1 that is not in T2. Let e = (u, v) with weight w(e).</p>
        <p>Add e to T2, forming a cycle C in T2 + e (since T2 is a tree, adding e connects u to v, which were already connected). Since e is not in T2, C contains at least one edge f ≠ e in T2. Because weights are distinct, either w(f) < w(e) or w(f) > w(e).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Case 1: w(f) > w(e).</strong> Construct T2' = T2 - f + e. T2' is a spanning tree (removing f disconnects T2, but e reconnects it). Weight of T2':</li>
            <p class="math">w(T2') = w(T2) - w(f) + w(e) < w(T2) = W</p>
            <p>This contradicts T2 being an MST, as T2' has lower weight.</p>
            <li><strong>Case 2: w(f) < w(e).</strong> Since e is in T1, consider T1 - e, which disconnects T1 into components C1 (containing u) and C2 (containing v). T2 connects C1 to C2 (it’s a spanning tree), so T2 has an edge f’ = (x, y) with x in C1, y in C2, f’ ≠ e. Since w(f’) < w(e) (all edges in T2’s cycle C with e have weights less than w(e)), construct T1' = T1 - e + f’. T1' is a spanning tree, with weight:</li>
            <p class="math">w(T1') = w(T1) - w(e) + w(f’) < w(T1) = W</p>
            <p>This contradicts T1 being an MST.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>In both cases, assuming two MSTs leads to a contradiction. Thus, there is exactly one MST.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A graph with distinct edge weights has exactly one MST, as the unique ordering of weights ensures a single optimal tree.</p>

        <h2>Question 6</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Assume that all edge weights in a graph are integers and take values between 1 and X (where X is a fixed number). How much can Kruskal’s MST algorithm be sped up in this case? Explain.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to determine how Kruskal’s MST algorithm can be optimized when edge weights are integers between 1 and X, where X is a constant.</p>
        <p><strong>Standard Kruskal’s Algorithm:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sort all edges by weight: O(E log E).</li>
            <li>Initialize a disjoint-set data structure for V vertices: O(V).</li>
            <li>Process edges in sorted order, adding each to the MST if it doesn’t form a cycle (using union-find): O(E α(V)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function.</li>
            <li>Total: O(E log E + V + E α(V)) ≈ O(E log E) since sorting dominates.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Optimization with Constant Weights:</strong> Edge weights are integers from 1 to X, so there are at most X distinct weights. We can use counting sort instead of comparison-based sorting to sort edges.</p>
        <p><strong>Optimized Algorithm:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sort Edges:</strong> Use counting sort:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create X buckets for weights 1 to X.</li>
                    <li>Place each edge in its weight’s bucket: O(E).</li>
                    <li>Collect edges in order: O(X + E).</li>
                    <li>Total: O(E + X). Since X is constant, this is O(E).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Disjoint-Set Operations:</strong> Same as standard: Initialize O(V), process E edges with O(E α(V)).</li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> O(E + V + E α(V)) = O(E + V), as α(V) is effectively constant for practical V.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong> Counting sort correctly orders edges since weights are integers from 1 to X. Kruskal’s algorithm then selects the minimum-weight edges that form a tree, unchanged by the sorting method.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> With edge weights as integers from 1 to X (X constant), Kruskal’s algorithm can be sped up to O(E + V) using counting sort for edges, reducing the sorting step from O(E log E) to O(E).</p>

        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Let a directed graph G=(V, E) and two flows f1 and f2 be given. The flow f3 is defined as follows: f3: V x V → R such that f3(x, y) = f1(x, y) + f2(x, y). According to this definition, is f3 a valid flow? Answer this question by considering the three fundamental properties of a flow.</p>

        <p><strong>Flow Properties:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Capacity Constraint:</strong> For all (x, y) in E, 0 ≤ f(x, y) ≤ c(x, y), where c(x, y) is the edge capacity.</li>

        <p><strong>Verification:</strong> Assume f1 and f2 satisfy these properties.</p>
        <ul>

                    <li>f1(x, y) ≥ 0, f2(x, y) ≥ 0, so f3(x, y) = f1(x, y) + f2(x, y) ≥ 0.</li>
                    <li>f1(x, y) ≤ c(x, y), f2(x, y) ≤ c(x, y). Thus, f3(x, y) = f1(x, y) + f2(x, y) ≤ c(x, y) + c(x, y) = 2 c(x, y).</li>

        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> In the discussion of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm in class, it was assumed that the graph is given as an adjacency list when analyzing its running time. What would be the running time of this algorithm if the graph is given as an adjacency matrix? Explain.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to analyze the time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm when the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, compared to the adjacency list assumption.</p>
        <p><strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Standard):</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Initialize distance[s] = 0, distance[v] = infinity for v ≠ s, and a priority queue with all vertices.</li>
            <li>Extract the vertex u with minimum distance: O(log V) with a binary heap.</li>
            <li>For each neighbor v of u, if w(u, v) < distance[v], update distance[v] and decrease key in queue: O(log V).</li>
            <li>Repeat V times.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Adjacency List Complexity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>V extract-min operations: O(V log V).</li>
            <li>For each edge (u, v), one decrease-key: O(E log V).</li>
            <li>Total: O(V log V + E log V).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Adjacency Matrix Representation:</strong> The graph is a V x V matrix where M[i][j] is the weight of edge (i, j) or infinity if no edge exists.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> O(V) for distance array and queue.</li>
            <li><strong>Extract-Min:</strong> Still O(log V) with a binary heap, V times: O(V log V).</li>
            <li><strong>Neighbor Access:</strong> For each vertex u extracted, check all V vertices v to find edges (u, v) by scanning row u in M. Each check is O(1), so O(V) per u. Update distance[v] and decrease-key (O(log V)) for each neighbor. Over V extractions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Scanning: V * O(V) = O(V^2).</li>
                    <li>Decrease-keys: At most V per vertex, up to E total, each O(log V): O(E log V). In a dense graph, E ≤ V^2, so O(V^2 log V).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> O(V log V + V^2 + E log V). Since E ≤ V^2, worst case is O(V^2 log V) for dense graphs, but scanning dominates as O(V^2) if we consider constant factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Simplification:</strong> To align with typical analysis, we can use an array instead of a priority queue (as in dense graphs), making extract-min O(V) (scan for min distance), V times: O(V^2). Neighbor updates per vertex are O(V), total O(V^2). This gives a cleaner O(V^2).</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> With an adjacency matrix, Dijkstra’s algorithm runs in O(V^2) time if using an array for minimum distance selection, or O(V^2 + E log V) with a priority queue, dominated by O(V^2) for scanning neighbors.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Considering your answer to the second question, suppose a graph is given as an adjacency matrix. Would you prefer to convert the adjacency matrix to an adjacency list before running Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, or is it more advantageous in terms of running time to run Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm directly with the adjacency matrix?</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to compare running Dijkstra’s algorithm directly on an adjacency matrix versus converting the matrix to an adjacency list first, in terms of time complexity.</p>
        <p><strong>Option 1: Run Dijkstra’s on Adjacency Matrix:</strong></p>
        <p>From Question 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using an array for minimum distance: O(V^2).</li>
            <li>Using a priority queue: O(V^2 + E log V), where E ≤ V^2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Best case: O(V^2) with an array, suitable for dense graphs.</p>
        <p><strong>Option 2: Convert to Adjacency List, Then Run Dijkstra’s:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Adjacency matrix is V x V. For each entry M[i][j]:

                    <li>Scanning V^2 entries: O(V^2).</li>
                    <li>Building lists: O(E) storage, but scanning time is O(V^2).</li>
                </ul>
                Total: O(V^2).</li>
            <li><strong>Dijkstra’s on Adjacency List:</strong> O(V log V + E log V).
                <ul>
                    <li>Sparse graph (E ≈ V): O(V log V).</li>
                    <li>Dense graph (E ≈ V^2): O(V^2 log V).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Total:</strong> O(V^2 + V log V + E log V).
                <ul>
                    <li>Sparse: O(V^2 + V log V) ≈ O(V^2).</li>
                    <li>Dense: O(V^2 + V^2 log V) ≈ O(V^2 log V).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sparse Graphs (E << V^2):</strong> Matrix: O(V^2). Convert + list: O(V^2 + V log V) ≈ O(V^2). Matrix is comparable or slightly better due to constant factors.</li>
            <li><strong>Dense Graphs (E ≈ V^2):</strong> Matrix: O(V^2). Convert + list: O(V^2 log V). Matrix is better, as O(V^2) < O(V^2 log V).</li>
            <li><strong>General Case:</strong> Matrix with array-based Dijkstra’s (O(V^2)) is simpler and often faster, especially for dense graphs, avoiding conversion overhead.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Running Dijkstra’s directly on the adjacency matrix (O(V^2)) is generally more advantageous than converting to an adjacency list (O(V^2)) and running Dijkstra’s (O(V log V + E log V)), especially for dense graphs, due to lower or comparable complexity and no conversion overhead.</p>

        <h2>Question 5</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Find the minimum cut in the network above. Show the steps as discussed in class.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to find the minimum cut in the network from Question 4, corresponding to the maximum flow, and show the steps. A cut (S, T) partitions vertices with s in S, t in T, and its capacity is the sum of capacities of edges from S to T.</p>
        <p><strong>Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem:</strong> The maximum flow equals the capacity of the minimum cut. After running Ford-Fulkerson, the minimum cut is found by identifying vertices reachable from s in the final residual graph (set S).</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Find Set S:</strong> Run BFS/DFS from s in residual graph:

                    <li>Edges with positive capacity: (s, a, 1).</li>
                    <li>From a: No outgoing edges with positive capacity ((a, b, 0), (a, t, 0)).</li>

                </ul>
                Cut capacity = 5 + 5 = 10.</li>
            <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Flow across cut: f(s, b) = 5, f(a, t) = 5, total = 10. Matches flow into t (14 in Question 4 seems inconsistent; assume typo or different network). Recalculate:
                <ul>
                    <li>Max flow was 14, suggesting cut capacity should be 14.</li>
                    <li>Possible error in assumed flow. Let’s try cut {s} vs {a, b, t}: Edges (s, a, 10), (s, b, 5). Capacity = 15 > 14.</li>
                    <li>Try {s, a, b} vs {t}: Edges (a, t, 5), (b, t, 10). Capacity = 15.</li>

                Minimum cut likely {s, a} vs {b, t} in residual context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Correctness:</strong> The minimum cut includes edges saturated in the max flow, found via residual graph reachability.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> For the assumed network, a minimum cut is ({s, a}, {b, t}) with capacity 10, but max flow suggests 14, indicating a possible network mismatch. Please provide the network for accuracy.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> For the given graph with n nodes, (a) find the shortest path tree, and (b) find the minimum spanning tree.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We need to find (a) the shortest path tree and (b) the minimum spanning tree (MST) of an n-node graph, but the graph is not provided. I’ll describe the algorithms and apply them to an assumed weighted graph. If you provide the graph, I can compute exact results.</p>

        <p><strong>Part (a): Shortest Path Tree</strong></p>
