  <h1>NP-Completeness & Computational Intractability</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Some problems are easy to solve. Others are hard. In computer science, we use special terms for this. One important
    concept is <strong>NP-Completeness</strong>.</p>

  <h2>2. What is a Problem?</h2>
  <p>In computer science, a problem is a question with an input and an answer. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sorting</strong>: Given a list of numbers, sort them from smallest to largest.</li>
    <li><strong>Path finding</strong>: Find the shortest path from one city to another on a map.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Easy vs Hard Problems</h2>
  <p>Some problems are easy to solve. For example, sorting can be done quickly. We say these problems are in class
    <strong>P</strong>. P means "solvable in polynomial time." That’s fast, even for big inputs.</p>
  <p>Some problems are different. They are hard to solve but easy to check. These are in class <strong>NP</strong>. NP
    means "nondeterministic polynomial time."</p>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example:</strong> Imagine a puzzle with 100 pieces. Solving it takes time. But if someone shows you a
    completed puzzle, it’s easy to check if it's correct.
  </div>

  <h2>4. NP-Complete Problems</h2>
  <p>NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP. If you can solve one NP-complete problem fast, you can solve
    all of them fast. But nobody knows how. Not yet.</p>

  <h3>Some NP-complete problems:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)</strong>: Given cities and distances, what is the shortest route
      that visits each city once and returns to the start?</li>
    <li><strong>Sudoku</strong>: Solving a large Sudoku puzzle is NP-complete.</li>
    <li><strong>Knapsack</strong>: You have a bag and items with weights and values. Pick items to maximize value
      without going over weight.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <strong>Real-life example:</strong> Imagine a delivery driver. They want to visit 10 locations using the least fuel.
    Trying all routes takes forever. That’s what makes it hard.
  </div>

  <h2>5. Why is it Important?</h2>
  <p>These problems are everywhere. Logistics, scheduling, networks, games. If we can solve NP-complete problems
    quickly, we can solve many real-world problems better.</p>
  <p>But right now, we don't know if P = NP. This is one of the biggest open questions in computer science.</p>

  <h2>6. What Can We Do?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Try small inputs</strong>: Many problems are hard only when inputs are big.</li>
    <li><strong>Use approximation</strong>: Get close to the best answer, even if not perfect.</li>
    <li><strong>Use heuristics</strong>: Smart guesses can help.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>P problems are fast to solve.</li>
    <li>NP problems are easy to check.</li>
    <li>NP-complete problems are the hardest in NP.</li>
    <li>We don't know if P = NP.</li>
    <li>These problems affect real life: travel, planning, games, and more.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep learning. NP-completeness is tricky, but it’s also fascinating!</p>
