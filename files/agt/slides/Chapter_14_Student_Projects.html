  <h1>üéì Student Projects in Algorithmic Game Theory</h1>

  <p>Are you studying algorithmic game theory?</p>
  <p>It sounds complex, but it can be fun too.</p>
  <p>Your final project is a great way to explore it.</p>

  <h2>üí≠ Why Do a Project?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Projects help you understand the topic deeply.</li>
    <li>You get to build something from scratch.</li>
    <li>You use both theory and coding skills.</li>
    <li>You can show it to future employers or on GitHub.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß© What Is Algorithmic Game Theory?</h2>

  <p>It combines computer science and economics.</p>
  <p>It studies how people make choices when there are rules and payoffs.</p>
  <p>It is used in auctions, markets, online ads, and more.</p>

  <p>Example: Google Ads uses auctions to decide which ads to show. That‚Äôs game theory!</p>

  <h2>üéØ Project Ideas (Simple but Cool)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Auction Simulator:</strong> Model a first-price or second-price auction.</li>
    <li><strong>Traffic Game:</strong> Simulate cars choosing different roads and finding equilibrium.</li>
    <li><strong>Voting Game:</strong> Study how groups make decisions using voting systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Model agents competing for bandwidth or CPU time.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Game:</strong> Simulate buyers and sellers with different strategies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You don‚Äôt need a complex interface. Even a simple console app works!</p>

  <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Tools You Can Use</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python:</strong> Great for quick prototypes and visualizations.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Nice for web-based simulators.</li>
    <li><strong>Java:</strong> Good for structured, large simulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> Perfect for explaining and showing results.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üè° Daily Life Example</h2>

  <p>Imagine three friends ordering pizza.</p>
  <p>Each one wants a different topping, but they must agree on one pizza.</p>
  <p>They each suggest a topping, and they vote.</p>
  <p>This is a simple voting game. It teaches fairness and strategy.</p>

  <h2>üß† What You Learn from These Projects</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>How to model real-life problems using algorithms.</li>
    <li>How to find stable outcomes (Nash equilibrium).</li>
    <li>How selfish agents affect the system.</li>
    <li>How theory applies to real-world software.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚è≥ Time Tips</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Start early. Game theory can be tricky.</li>
    <li>Work in pairs if allowed. Two brains are better than one.</li>
    <li>Test your code often.</li>
    <li>Keep things simple at first. Add features later.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>üåü Want Extra Credit? Try This!</h2>

    <h3>1. Build a Game Theory Simulator</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulate how players act in different games.</li>
      <li>Let users enter payoffs and strategies.</li>
      <li>Show equilibrium outcomes visually.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Study a Research Paper</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick a short paper on auctions, matching markets, or pricing.</li>
      <li>Summarize the main idea in a short report.</li>
      <li>Try to code a simple version of what the paper describes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ask your professor to suggest a paper or tool to start with.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>üöÄ Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Algorithmic game theory is more than just math.</p>
  <p>It helps us understand people, systems, and choices.</p>
  <p>Your project can be small or big ‚Äî but start it now!</p>
  <p>And most of all, enjoy the process of learning and building!</p>
