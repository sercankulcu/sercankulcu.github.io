  <h1>🧠 Reinforcement Learning and No-Regret Learning in Games</h1>

  <p>Have you ever learned something by trial and error?</p>
  <p>Like playing a video game and getting better with time?</p>
  <p>That’s the basic idea behind <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>.</p>

  <h2>🎮 What Is Reinforcement Learning?</h2>

  <p>It’s a way to learn by doing.</p>
  <p>You try something. If it works, great! If not, you adjust.</p>

  <p>This is how AI agents learn to play games.</p>
  <p>They don’t know the best move at first. But over time, they learn from feedback.</p>

  <h2>🧩 A Simple Example</h2>

  <p>Imagine a robot in a maze.</p>
  <p>Every time it hits a wall, it gets -1 point.</p>
  <p>When it finds the exit, it gets +10 points.</p>
  <p>At first, the robot moves randomly. But after many tries, it learns the best path.</p>
  <p>That’s reinforcement learning!</p>

  <h2>🕹️ RL in Games</h2>

  <p>Reinforcement learning is popular in AI for games.</p>
  <p>It helped DeepMind beat top players in Go and StarCraft.</p>
  <p>Games are great for RL because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They have clear rules.</li>
    <li>They give rewards (win or lose).</li>
    <li>You can play many times to improve.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📉 What Is No-Regret Learning?</h2>

  <p>No-regret learning is a smart way to make decisions.</p>
  <p>In simple words: you want to avoid looking back and saying, “I should have done something else every time.”</p>

  <p>Over time, a no-regret learner does almost as well as the best fixed strategy in hindsight.</p>

  <h2>🍕 Real-Life Example</h2>

  <p>You try different pizza places for lunch.</p>
  <p>Some are good. Some are bad.</p>
  <p>Each day, you pick based on past experience.</p>
  <p>Eventually, you mostly go to the best one.</p>
  <p>You may regret some choices. But overall, your regret is small.</p>

  <h2>🎓 In Game Theory</h2>

  <p>No-regret algorithms are used when players don’t know what others will do.</p>
  <p>Each player updates their strategy based on outcomes.</p>
  <p>If all players use no-regret learning, the game may reach an <strong>equilibrium</strong>.</p>

  <p>This is helpful when computing Nash equilibrium is too hard.</p>
  <p>Instead of solving the game directly, players learn it!</p>

  <h2>📚 Algorithms You May Hear About</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multiplicative Weights</strong>: updates probabilities of actions based on success.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow the Leader (FTL)</strong>: picks the strategy that worked best so far.</li>
    <li><strong>Q-learning</strong>: famous in RL. Learns the value of actions over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💻 Applications</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Online ads: systems learn which ad to show.</li>
    <li>Traffic routing: systems learn the best paths over time.</li>
    <li>Trading bots: they learn to buy or sell based on market feedback.</li>
    <li>Robot control: learn how to walk, jump, or fly!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💡 Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Reinforcement learning is learning by trial and error.</li>
    <li>No-regret learning means making better choices over time.</li>
    <li>Both are used in games, AI, and real-world systems.</li>
    <li>You can learn good strategies without knowing the full game.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So next time you try something new and improve over time, congrats — you're doing reinforcement learning! 😄</p>
