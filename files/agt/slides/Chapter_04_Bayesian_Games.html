  <h1>🎲 Bayesian Games and Incomplete Information</h1>

  <p>In real life, we often make decisions without knowing everything. That's what Bayesian games are about.</p>

  <h2>🔍 What is a Bayesian Game?</h2>

  <p>A Bayesian game is a game with incomplete information. Each player has private information. This is called their
    <strong>type</strong>.</p>

  <p>For example, imagine two people are playing poker. You don't know your opponent's cards. But you may have a belief
    about what they could have.</p>

  <p>Bayesian games help us model this kind of situation.</p>

  <h2>🧠 Players Have Beliefs</h2>

  <p>Each player doesn't know everything. But they have beliefs about others.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You're selling a used phone.</li>
    <li>You don't know how much the buyer is willing to pay.</li>
    <li>But you guess they are either a student 💼 or a tech lover 🤓.</li>
    <li>You believe there is a 60% chance they are a student, and 40% chance they are a tech lover.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This belief affects your pricing strategy.</p>

  <h2>📦 Daily Life Example: Online Shopping</h2>

  <p>Think about Amazon. It wants to set prices for you.</p>
  <p>But it doesn't know exactly how much you are willing to pay.</p>
  <p>Maybe it knows you are a frequent shopper. Or maybe it thinks you are just browsing.</p>
  <p>It uses your profile (your "type") to make pricing or ad decisions.</p>

  <h2>🏦 Another Example: Salary Negotiation</h2>

  <p>You apply for a job. You don’t know how much the company is willing to pay.</p>
  <p>The company also doesn’t know your true skill level.</p>
  <p>Both sides have incomplete information.</p>
  <p>But both try to make smart choices based on what they believe.</p>

  <h2>🧩 Key Parts of a Bayesian Game</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Players</strong> — who is in the game</li>
    <li><strong>Types</strong> — what private information each player has</li>
    <li><strong>Beliefs</strong> — what each player believes about others' types</li>
    <li><strong>Strategies</strong> — what action to take for each possible type</li>
    <li><strong>Payoffs</strong> — the result each player gets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Why It Matters</h2>

  <p>Bayesian games are used in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI and robotics 🤖</li>
    <li>Auctions (like Google ads) 💰</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity 🎯</li>
    <li>Negotiations and contracts 📝</li>
    <li>Economics and marketing 📊</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✅ Summary</h2>

  <p>Bayesian games are powerful tools.</p>
  <p>They help model real-world situations where players have private info.</p>
  <p>By using beliefs, players can still make smart choices.</p>

  <p>Remember: just because you don’t know everything doesn’t mean you can’t play smart! 😄</p>
