  <h1>⚙️ Computational Complexity of Equilibria</h1>

  <p>Finding a solution is one thing. But how hard is it to find that solution?</p>
  <p>In game theory, the solution is often a Nash equilibrium. But computing it can be tricky.</p>

  <h2>🎯 What is a Nash Equilibrium?</h2>

  <p>In a game, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies. No player wants to change their strategy if the others stay
    the same.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You and a friend are deciding which restaurant to go to.</li>
    <li>If you both choose the same place, you’re happy.</li>
    <li>Once you both pick one place, and neither wants to switch — that’s equilibrium.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Finding that sweet spot is easy in small games. But it gets hard fast.</p>

  <h2>🧠 Why is It Hard?</h2>

  <p>Games with many players and choices are complicated.</p>
  <p>There may be many equilibria. Or none in pure strategies.</p>
  <p>So we need to look for mixed strategies. That means players randomize.</p>
  <p>Computers struggle with these cases. They must check many possibilities.</p>

  <h2>⏱️ What Is Computational Complexity?</h2>

  <p>It tells us how hard a problem is to solve using a computer.</p>
  <p>Some problems are easy. We can solve them in <code>polynomial time</code>.</p>
  <p>Others are hard. They may take too long, even on fast machines.</p>

  <h2>🚧 Nash Equilibrium Is PPAD-Complete</h2>

  <p>This is an important result.</p>
  <p>Finding a Nash equilibrium is in a class called <strong>PPAD</strong>.</p>

  <p>PPAD stands for "Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed version."</p>
  <p>It sounds scary, but here’s the idea:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some problems are guaranteed to have a solution.</li>
    <li>But it’s hard to find the solution.</li>
    <li>These problems live in PPAD.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Nash equilibrium is one of them. We know one always exists (thanks to Nash!). But finding it is hard.</p>
  <p>In fact, it’s <strong>PPAD-complete</strong>. That means it’s one of the hardest problems in this class.</p>

  <h2>📦 Real-Life Example: Online Ads</h2>

  <p>Companies compete for ad space on Google.</p>
  <p>Each company has a strategy: how much to bid, when to show the ad, etc.</p>
  <p>Google wants to compute an equilibrium. That way, ads are shown fairly and profitably.</p>
  <p>But computing this is not easy. It may require solving a PPAD-complete problem.</p>

  <h2>🏦 Another Example: Stock Market</h2>

  <p>Traders make choices based on others' moves.</p>
  <p>They want to reach a stable state. No one wants to trade differently.</p>
  <p>Finding this stable point is like computing an equilibrium. And it’s complex.</p>

  <h2>🔧 Can We Approximate It?</h2>

  <p>Yes! In practice, we use algorithms that find <strong>approximate equilibria</strong>.</p>
  <p>They may not be perfect. But they’re close enough.</p>
  <p>And they run faster. This is helpful for real-time systems.</p>

  <h2>💡 Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Nash equilibria are stable points in games.</li>
    <li>Finding them is hard. Especially in big games.</li>
    <li>The problem is PPAD-complete. This means it’s very complex.</li>
    <li>In real life, we often use approximations.</li>
    <li>This happens in ads, auctions, finance, and more.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So next time you play a strategy game or bid online, remember: even the computer might struggle to find the best
    move! 😄</p>
