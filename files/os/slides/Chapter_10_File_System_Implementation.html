  <h1>File System Implementation Details</h1>

  <p>
    A file system helps the computer keep track of files. It controls how data is stored and retrieved.
  </p>

  <h2>What is a File System?</h2>
  <p>
    A file system is part of the operating system. It organizes data on a storage device like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hard disks</li>
    <li>Solid-state drives (SSDs)</li>
    <li>USB drives</li>
    <li>Memory cards</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    Think of a file system like a bookshelf. It keeps books (files) in order, with labels and shelves (folders).
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Main Jobs of a File System</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Store data in files</li>
    <li>Organize files into directories (folders)</li>
    <li>Track where data is stored on the disk</li>
    <li>Manage space (free and used)</li>
    <li>Protect data (permissions, access control)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>File Control Block (FCB)</h2>
  <p>
    Every file has a small data structure called a <strong>File Control Block</strong> or <strong>FCB</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FCB stores information like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>File name</li>
    <li>Location on disk</li>
    <li>Size</li>
    <li>Owner</li>
    <li>Access rights (read, write, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Storage Blocks</h2>
  <p>
    The disk is divided into small pieces called <strong>blocks</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Files are saved in these blocks. The file system keeps track of which blocks belong to which file.
  </p>

  <h2>Daily Life Analogy</h2>
  <blockquote>
    Imagine storing socks in drawers.
    Each drawer holds a few socks.
    You write on paper which drawer has which socks.
    That paper is like the file table.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>How Files are Stored</h2>
  <p>
    There are several ways files can be stored on disk:
  </p>

  <h3>1. Contiguous Allocation</h3>
  <p>
    The file is stored in one big block of space.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong> Fast access.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cons:</strong> Hard to find big enough empty space.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Linked Allocation</h3>
  <p>
    Each part of the file is stored separately. Each block points to the next.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to grow files.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cons:</strong> Slower to read all parts.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Indexed Allocation</h3>
  <p>
    The file has an index block. The index lists all the block locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to access blocks directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cons:</strong> Slightly more complex.
  </p>

  <h2>Directory Structure</h2>
  <p>
    Files are placed in directories (folders). This creates a tree-like structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
  </p>
  <pre>
  /
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alice
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ homework.txt
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bob
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.doc
  </pre>

  <h2>Mounting a File System</h2>
  <p>
    A file system must be "mounted" before use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mounting connects the storage device to the OS's file structure.
  </p>

  <h2>File Access Methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sequential:</strong> Read from start to end (like a tape).</li>
    <li><strong>Direct:</strong> Jump to a specific part (like a CD).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Free Space Management</h2>
  <p>
    The OS must also track empty blocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may use:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A bitmap (1 = used, 0 = free)</li>
    <li>A list of free blocks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>File System Types</h2>
  <p>
    There are many file system formats. Each has its own features.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>FAT32:</strong> Simple, used in USB drives.</li>
    <li><strong>NTFS:</strong> Used by Windows. Supports permissions and recovery.</li>
    <li><strong>ext4:</strong> Used in Linux. Fast and reliable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Daily Life Analogy: Office Cabinet</h2>
  <blockquote>
    Think of a file system like a filing cabinet in an office.
    Each drawer (folder) holds files.
    You have a sheet that shows what file is in which drawer and what page it starts on.
    That sheet is like the directory table.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A file system organizes files on disk.</li>
    <li>It uses blocks, tables, and indexes to track data.</li>
    <li>There are different ways to store files (contiguous, linked, indexed).</li>
    <li>Directories help organize files like folders on a desk.</li>
    <li>File systems manage both data and free space.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìò Key Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Block:</strong> Small unit of storage.</li>
    <li><strong>FCB:</strong> Holds file metadata.</li>
    <li><strong>Directory:</strong> Folder that holds files.</li>
    <li><strong>Mounting:</strong> Connecting a file system to the OS.</li>
    <li><strong>Allocation:</strong> How file data is stored on disk.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Try It Yourself</h2>
  <p>
    Open a command terminal:
  </p>
  <p>
    In Linux:
  </p>
  <pre><code>df -h</code></pre>
  <p>Shows your mounted file systems.</p>

  <p>
    In Windows:
  </p>
  <pre><code>diskpart</code></pre>
  <p>View and manage disks and volumes.</p>

  <p><strong>Great work! üéâ</strong></p>
