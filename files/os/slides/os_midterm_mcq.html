    <div class="question">
        <p>193. How does the concept of aging mitigate starvation in scheduling algorithms?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <p>A) By reducing the priority of long-waiting processes over time</p>
            <p>B) By preempting processes with lower priority</p>
            <p>C) By randomly selecting processes for execution</p>
            <p>D) By restarting the system periodically</p>
