        <p>154. Which disk scheduling algorithm prioritizes requests close to the current position of the disk head, then moves in the direction of increasing track numbers until reaching the last track, and then reverses direction?</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p>155. What distinguishes synchronous I/O from asynchronous I/O?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <p>A) Synchronous I/O allows the CPU to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O completion, while asynchronous I/O blocks the CPU until the I/O operation is finished.</p>
            <p>B) Synchronous I/O guarantees immediate completion of I/O operations, while asynchronous I/O requires explicit polling for completion status.</p>
            <p>C) Synchronous I/O involves direct communication between the CPU and I/O device, while asynchronous I/O relies on interrupts for communication.</p>
            <p>D) Synchronous I/O transfers data directly between memory and I/O devices, while asynchronous I/O buffers data in memory before transferring.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p>156. Which of the following is a characteristic of buffered I/O?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <p>A) It transfers data directly between memory and I/O devices.</p>
            <p>B) It requires explicit intervention from the CPU for each data transfer operation.</p>
            <p>C) It uses a buffer to temporarily store data during I/O transfers.</p>
            <p>D) It is slower compared to direct I/O techniques.</p>
