In this paper; A new parent selection function is proposed for RPL running on top of IETF 6TiSCH protocol stack, which, for each node, takes into account the number of neighbors and the traffic through these routing nodes. Our tests showed a significant improvement in terms of the total number of parent switches and packet delivery rates.
