This study proposes an automatic classification system for hazelnut fruit using deep learning, comparing the performance of ResNet-50 and ShuffleNet algorithms on a dataset of 15,770 hazelnut images. ShuffleNet, with its lower resource demands, is recommended for real-time analysis due to its comparable accuracy (99.94% in testing) to ResNet-50 (99.97% in testing).
