This study investigates the use of the ShuffleNet deep learning algorithm to classify hazelnut fruits into good, bad, and inner categories, achieving high accuracy with a dataset of 15,770 images. Among the optimizers tested, ShuffleNet with ADAM demonstrated the best performance, with 99.89% training accuracy, 99.96% test accuracy, and superior metrics including 0.9997 precision, 1 specificity, and 0.9998 F1-score.
