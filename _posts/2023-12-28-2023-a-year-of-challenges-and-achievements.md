I took on the role of an Assistant Professor, and the journey had unexpected events like a major surgery, health issues within my family, starting a website, and picking up new hobbies. This post gives an honest overview of the good and bad moments that shaped my year. The foundation of everything in life is undoubtedly health. Without it, even the biggest achievements and detailed plans can fall apart. Health quietly influences our daily activities, professional goals, and personal relationships.

A significant moment in 2023 was achieving the title of Assistant Professor. This academic achievement acknowledged my commitment to teaching and research, creating new opportunities for professional growth and contributions to the academic community.

However, amidst professional successes, a notable challenge arose during my surgery. The recovery phase was tougher than expected, making it hard for me to sit for long periods and temporarily disrupting my work routine. This experience emphasized the importance of resilience and adaptability when facing unexpected health obstacles.

At the same time as my health journey, the year brought challenges through my spouse’s health issues. Dealing with the emotional and physical toll of supporting a loved one through health challenges became a significant part of the year. This time tested our resilience and highlighted the crucial role of family support during tough times.

To expand my academic outreach, I started a website. This platform became a place to share lecture notes and educational resources, creating a digital community for students and fellow educators. The website showcases the changing landscape of education and the impact of digital platforms in spreading knowledge.

In terms of travel, 2023 brought about several firsts as I visited İzmir and Diyarbakır for the first time. These trips not only broadened my cultural understanding but also provided chances to connect with relatives I hadn’t met before. These encounters added a new layer to my understanding of family connections and heritage.

On a personal note, the year saw a significant achievement in my wellness journey – losing 18 kilograms. With a goal of losing an additional 10 kilograms, this effort reflects my commitment to a healthier lifestyle and serves as a reminder of the impact of gradual, sustainable changes.

One of the pleasant surprises in 2023 was starting chess games with my son. This new shared interest not only strengthened our father-son bond but also introduced a fun challenge as my son began to challenge me in our chess matches.

In conclusion, 2023 was a year of diverse experiences – from professional achievements to health challenges, family dynamics, digital initiatives, cultural exploration, personal wellness, and new hobbies. As I look back on the year, I carry forward the lessons learned and the resilience gained, facing the uncertainties of the future with optimism and a commitment to continuous growth.
