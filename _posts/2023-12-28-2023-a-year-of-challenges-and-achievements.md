As I embraced the role of an Assistant Professor, the journey took unexpected turns, including a significant surgery, family health challenges, the launch of a website, and newfound hobbies. This post offers a candid overview of the highs and lows that defined my year.

One of the defining moments of 2023 was the attainment of the title of Assistant Professor. This academic milestone marked the recognition of my dedication to teaching and research, opening new avenues for professional growth and contribution to the academic community.

However, amidst professional achievements, a notable challenge emerged as I underwent surgery. The recovery phase proved to be more demanding than anticipated, hindering my ability to sit for extended periods and temporarily disrupting my routine work. The experience highlighted the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of unexpected health hurdles.

Parallel to my own health journey, the year brought forth challenges in the form of my spouse's health issues. Coping with the emotional and physical toll of supporting a loved one through health challenges became a central aspect of the year. This period tested our resilience and underlined the crucial role of familial support in navigating difficult times.

In a bid to enhance academic outreach, I initiated the creation of a website. This platform became a space to share lecture notes and educational resources, fostering a digital community for students and fellow educators. The website stands as a testament to the evolving landscape of education and the power of digital platforms in facilitating knowledge dissemination.

Geographically, 2023 brought about a series of firsts as I visited İzmir and Diyarbakır for the first time. The trips not only broadened my cultural horizons but also provided opportunities to connect with long-lost relatives, some of whom I hadn't met or known of before. These encounters added a new dimension to my understanding of family ties and heritage.

On a personal note, the year witnessed a remarkable achievement in my wellness journey – shedding 18 kilograms. With a goal of losing an additional 10 kilograms, this endeavor reflects a commitment to a healthier lifestyle and serves as a reminder of the impact of gradual, sustainable changes.

Among the pleasant surprises of 2023 was the initiation of chess games with my son. This newfound shared interest not only deepened our father-son bond but also introduced a delightful challenge as my son began to push me in our chess matches.

In conclusion, the year 2023 encapsulated a myriad of experiences – from professional accomplishments to health challenges, family dynamics, digital ventures, cultural exploration, personal wellness, and newfound hobbies. As I reflect on the year gone by, I carry forward the lessons learned and the resilience gained, embracing the uncertainties of the future with optimism and a commitment to continuous growth.
