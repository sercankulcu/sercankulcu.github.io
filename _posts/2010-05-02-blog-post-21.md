I hadn't seen "Jeux d'enfants" till yesterday, but by a wonderful coincidence, I watched it for an hour and a half while smoking cigarettes and losing myself in the story. I was overcome by memories of Sophie, my childhood closest friend, whom I hadn't seen since we were split up by my father's move when I was 11 years old, and I started crying as soon as it was done. Even by mistake, I had already made up my mind that I didn't want to see this movie again, yet here I was sobbing uncontrollably.

I was impressed by how Sophie and Julien's games and bravery tests provided them the strength and support they needed to face obstacles as youngsters as I watched the movie, which covers the lives of the friends. However, as they aged, their bond got more complicated, and the dares acquired more significance. Sophie was a highly dependable friend, but she had to learn to let go of her anxieties since she fought with insecurity. Julien, on the other hand, had a propensity for acting rashly and making poor choices without taking the repercussions into account. Julien was a kind and compassionate guy who gave his all to the people he cared about, despite her flaws.

I was so captivated by Sophie and Julien's narrative by the time the movie was through that I was unable to control my emotions. I knew I didn't want to see the movie again, at least not anytime soon, despite my strong emotional response. I had been tremendously moved by the movie in some way, and I wasn't prepared to experience similar emotions again. I thus crossed the film off my list.
