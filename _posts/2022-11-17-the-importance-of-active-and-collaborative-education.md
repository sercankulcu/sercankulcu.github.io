However, this approach does not foster critical thinking or deep understanding of the material. A better approach is to provide students with opportunities for active and collaborative learning, where they can engage with the material in a meaningful way. One of the best ways to do this is by incorporating seminars into each class, allowing students to discuss, analyze, and apply concepts interactively. This not only deepens their comprehension but also enhances communication and teamwork skills.

Seminars are interactive sessions where students can discuss and analyze the material in a group setting. They provide an opportunity for students to share their own perspectives and engage in critical thinking, rather than just passively listening to a lecture. By participating in seminars, students can develop their analytical, critical and communicational skills, which are essential for success in their future careers.

Seminars also allow for a deeper understanding of the material. In a traditional lecture-based class, students may only be exposed to the surface-level information. However, in a seminar setting, students can delve deeper into the material and explore its nuances and complexities. This leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, which is crucial for long-term retention and application of the information.

It's important to note that seminars should not be used as an alternative to lectures, but rather as a supplement. Lectures provide a foundation of knowledge, while seminars allow for in-depth exploration and analysis of that knowledge. By incorporating both lectures and seminars, students can have a well-rounded educational experience that promotes both passive and active learning.

In a rote-learning education system, students are often placed in a passive position where they are expected to simply absorb information without questioning or challenging it. They are seen as empty vessels to be filled by the teacher, rather than active participants in their own learning. In this type of system, the emphasis is on the teacher to deliver as much information as possible, rather than on the student to engage with and understand the material.

This approach to education stifles creativity, critical thinking, and independent problem-solving skills. Students are not encouraged to explore new ideas, form their own opinions or challenge the status quo. They are conditioned to accept information at face value, without questioning its validity or applicability. They are not taught how to think for themselves but only how to repeat the information they were taught.

Moreover, this type of education system promotes the idea that the more information a teacher can deliver to the students, the better teacher they are. This approach doesn't consider the fact that the quality of education is not only measured by the amount of information passed on but also by the student's engagement and understanding.

In the same line of thought, this system also evaluates the students based on their ability to absorb the information without questioning. The more they can memorize the information without questioning it, the better students they are. This approach doesn't take into account the student's creativity, their ability to think critically, or their ability to apply the knowledge they gained to real-world situations.
