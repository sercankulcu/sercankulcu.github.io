The phrase "Never touch your idols - the gilding will stick" is a powerful reminder that the people we idolize and look up to are not perfect and their flaws will inevitably be exposed. It suggests that by holding these individuals to such high standards, we risk being disappointed when we inevitably find out that they are not who we thought they were.

However, it is not only about the idols that we admire, but also the way we perceive and understand the world around us. The phrase also highlights the importance of being realistic and understanding that there is no such thing as a perfect person or situation. When we idolize someone or something, we tend to see only the good, the beauty and the success, and ignore the truth, essence and essence of the events.

This idea of not touching the idols also applies to our own self-perception. We often put ourselves under pressure to live up to the ideals we see in others, but this can lead to disappointment and dissatisfaction when we inevitably fall short. It is important to remember that everyone has their own flaws and imperfections, and it is unrealistic to expect ourselves to be perfect.

The phrase also touches on the sadness of being realistic and how it can be difficult to accept that life is not always beautiful, good and successful. But, it is important to remember that it is through facing and accepting the difficulties of life that we grow and become stronger. It is through understanding the truth, essence and essence of events that we can learn to appreciate the good and the beautiful in life in a more authentic and meaningful way.
