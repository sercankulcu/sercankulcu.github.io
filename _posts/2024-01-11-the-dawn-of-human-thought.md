They found themselves in awe of forces beyond their understanding, forces they referred to as "gods." They felt vulnerable and frightened by these powerful, unseen forces that controlled their lives. Yet, rather than spending time contemplating the mysteries of life, they were more focused on surviving—dealing with daily challenges and battling nature itself.

The words they used were the first oral records, and these words varied from one culture to another. Over time, each culture assigned specific names to everything around them: the sun, the moon, birth, death, trees, roads, stones, people, and tools. Every part of their environment was named according to their understanding.

Humans initially communicated with simple symbols, using gestures and body movements to distinguish themselves from other living creatures. Over time, they developed a growing awareness of their uniqueness compared to the animals around them.

When they found themselves alone and afraid, especially in the face of natural events like thunderstorms or darkness, their minds turned to the words they had created. For example, while sitting in a dark cave during a thunderstorm, they might have been terrified by the sounds of rain, lightning, and thunder. Perhaps the first thought that came to mind was the sun, which appeared each morning and brought light. They believed that by repeating the name of the sun, the clouds might clear, the darkness would fade, and the terrifying sounds from the sky would stop. Even now, humans are instinctively afraid of darkness, sudden flashes of light, and loud noises.

Thousands of years passed.

Stories, myths, and legends were passed down from generation to generation. People began to use symbols not just to communicate ideas but to bring these concepts into their everyday lives. They drew circles on rocks, for example, to represent the continuity of life. They wanted to believe that life didn’t end with death, despite its hardships. Life, after all, was sweet.

Humans gradually learned how to live in harmony with nature. They believed that some great unknown force had created the universe, the stars, planets, and themselves. This force, they thought, provided them with the animals they hunted and the fruits they gathered.

To protect themselves from wild animals and to live more efficiently, people formed societies. Each tribe or culture, no matter where they were, shared a similar way of thinking. They believed in a higher power that governed everything—this power made the sun rise each day, made the rain fall, and caused trees to bear fruit. It was everywhere, even though they couldn’t see it. If it didn’t exist, they believed, neither would the world around them.

Over time, the idea of a single, all-encompassing power became central to human thought, even in its earliest, most primitive forms. At the same time, humans began wondering about their own existence. How were they different from other animals? They didn’t believe they had evolved from animals—they were convinced that they were created in a completely different way. After all, animals remained unchanged, while humans were constantly evolving and progressing.

The only thing they knew for sure was that after mating, another human would be born—sometimes a boy, sometimes a girl. This was similar to what they observed in other animals. Maybe this was the only similarity they shared with other creatures. Animals also reproduced, their offspring resembling them, and this cycle of life continued, with some dying but the species surviving.

Humans connected their own reproduction with the growth of plants and animals. They began to see themselves as gods, like those who had created them. They believed they were the masters of the green meadows, rivers, and hills. Like the great power above, they could take a life or give it. They saw themselves as gods on earth, even though they didn’t fully understand this concept at the time.

Primitive humans tried to make sense of the world around them. They believed that some part of their essence would merge with the air after death, returning to the invisible force that surrounded them. They knew the names, sounds, and symbols of things, and they believed these could be used to influence the world around them.

By thousands of years later, these ideas had developed into myths, mysteries, religions, and sacred texts. At the core of this human thought lay a path—one that offered both self-improvement and the ability to influence others. This was the beginning of what we now call “scientific inquiry,” a method of understanding and explaining the world.

While much of this early development happened in distant parts of the world, the clearest evidence comes from closer regions like Ancient Egypt and Sumer. These ancient civilizations developed in an environment where humans sought to connect with higher powers while also trying to control nature through practices like magic and divination.

But where did the concept of "evil" come from in these early beliefs?

Humans were not always good, and often saw themselves as the good ones while others were the bad. This led to conflicts, as each group wanted to defeat what they saw as evil in the other. When one culture conquered another, the gods of the defeated became the demons and evil spirits of the victors.

Over time, some of these deities, like Pan, became associated with evil, especially in later cultures. For example, the Greek god Pan, once a symbol of nature and fertility, was later depicted as the embodiment of sin and evil by Christianity. This transformation showed how one culture's deity could become another’s symbol of evil.

Despite these shifts, early human beliefs were always focused on goodness, beauty, and trying to understand the world. Yet over time, as religions like Christianity emerged, much of this early thinking was pushed aside, sometimes in ways that distorted its original intent.

In conclusion, what began as a simple effort to make sense of the world—by naming, observing, and creating symbols—evolved into a complex web of myths, beliefs, and spiritual practices. These early efforts laid the foundation for both religious and scientific inquiry, as humans sought to understand and influence the world around them.
