Once upon a serene coastal town, there lived an avid fisherman named Hasan. His heart beat for the thrill of the ocean, and his favorite pursuit was none other than the elusive Lendonoz—a fish renowned for being the most enjoyable catch.

Equipped with his trusty fishing gear, Hasan set out for the rocky shores, ready to entice the Lendonoz with his preferred bait—travla, a choice that had proven successful for him in the past. Some anglers favored saka (pisbıyık) or cane, but Hasan believed in the irresistible allure of travla.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Hasan cast his line into the calm waters, patiently waiting for the telltale sign of a Lendonoz on the other end. Unlike other fish that nibble or tap the line, the Lendonoz was a crafty creature. It didn't give a distinct tug; instead, it swallowed the bait, leaving an ephemeral void before abruptly anchoring itself like a live anchor.

The sensation was exquisite—reminiscent of a dance between man and nature. Hasan skillfully maneuvered his fishing rod, reeling in the Lendonoz with a finesse that spoke of years spent honing his craft. The creature, though powerful, succumbed to the determined angler's expertise.

For a Lendonoz weighing 2 kilograms or more, Hasan always kept a sturdy gedal by his side. Extracting this feisty fish from the depths required every ounce of his strength and patience, but the reward was well worth the effort.

Once ashore, Hasan marveled at his catch—a magnificent Lendonoz, glistening in the twilight. With a satisfied smile, he transported his prize home. In the comfort of his kitchen, Hasan laid the fish in a pan, generously adorned it with tomato slices, and showered it with an abundance of crushed garlic.

The aroma wafted through his home as the Lendonoz sizzled in the pan, creating a symphony of flavors. Hasan couldn't help but savor the anticipation, knowing that this culinary masterpiece was the culmination of his skill and the ocean's generosity.

The dish was a triumph—a celebration of the Lendonoz and Hasan's prowess as a fisherman. As he sat down to enjoy the fruits of his labor, Hasan couldn't help but think, "I love these moments. I love these fish." And so, the tale of Hasan and the Lendonoz became a story whispered among fellow fishermen, an ode to the joy of the perfect catch.
