<img width="150" alt="diploma" src="/images/posts/to-be-a-student-or-to-graduate.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> As a student, your focus is on learning and gaining knowledge and skills that will help you pursue your career goals. You are exposed to a wide range of ideas and perspectives which can help you develop critical thinking skills. However, as you transition into your professional career, you will be expected to apply those skills to real-world projects. This may require you to adapt your approach to problem-solving and decision-making, and to develop strong communication and collaboration skills to work effectively with colleagues and clients. Going from a passive learner to an active participant in a professional setting can be challenging, but with the right mindset and willingness to learn, you can be successful in achieving your career goals. 

Main difference between being a student and being a software engineer after graduation
=====

As a student studying software engineering, there are a few things you can do to prepare for your future career:

<b>Focus on your studies:</b> While you are in school, it's important to put your best effort into your coursework and projects. This will not only help you do well academically, but it will also give you the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in your future career as a software engineer.

<b>Gain practical experience:</b> In addition to your classroom studies, consider seeking out opportunities to gain hands-on experience in software development. This could be through internships, co-op programs, or personal projects. This will give you valuable real-world experience and help you build your portfolio.

<b>Network with industry professionals:</b> Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and reach out to people in the field to build your network and learn more about what it's like to work as a software engineer.

After graduation, there are a few key things you can do to kickstart your career as a software engineer:

<b>Look for job opportunities:</b> Start applying for software engineering positions that interest you and align with your skills and goals. Consider reaching out to recruiters or networking with industry professionals to find job openings that may not be advertised publicly.

<b>Keep learning:</b> Even after you graduate, it's important to stay up-to-date with new technologies and trends in the field. Consider taking online courses, attending conferences, or reading industry publications to continue learning and growing as a software engineer.

<b>Build your professional portfolio:</b> As you gain experience in your career, be sure to document your projects and accomplishments in a professional portfolio. This can help you demonstrate your skills and expertise to potential employers and clients.

It's important to continue learning and growing throughout your career, but after graduation, you will have more opportunities to put your skills into practice and build your professional reputation.

Is a diploma required?
=====

In many cases, a diploma or degree in computer science or a related field is required for software engineering positions. Employers often look for candidates with formal education in computer science or a related field because it helps to ensure that they have a solid foundation in programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and other important topics.

Having a diploma or degree also demonstrates to potential employers that you have the discipline and motivation to complete a rigorous academic program, and that you are committed to your field of study.

That being said, it's important to note that a diploma or degree is not the only factor that employers consider when hiring software engineers. Many employers also place a strong emphasis on practical experience and skills, and may be willing to consider candidates without formal education if they can demonstrate a strong understanding of programming concepts and have a portfolio of relevant projects.

What are the difficulties faced by those without a degree?
=====

There are a few potential difficulties that individuals without a degree in computer science or a related field may face when seeking software engineering positions:

<b>Limited job opportunities:</b> Many software engineering positions require a degree in computer science or a related field as a minimum qualification. This means that individuals without a degree may have fewer job opportunities available to them.

<b>Competition with candidates with degrees:</b> Even if a degree is not a strict requirement for a software engineering position, candidates with a degree may be preferred over those without one due to the perceived benefits of formal education. This can make it more challenging for individuals without a degree to stand out and compete with candidates who do have a degree.

<b>Limited professional recognition:</b> In some cases, having a degree in computer science or a related field may be viewed as a mark of professional credibility and expertise. Without a degree, individuals may find it more difficult to be taken seriously or to be recognized as professionals in their field.

<b>Limited access to networking opportunities:</b> Many academic programs in computer science and related fields offer opportunities for students to network with industry professionals and build their professional networks. Without a degree, individuals may have fewer opportunities to make these connections and build their networks.

That being said, it's important to note that these difficulties are not insurmountable. Many individuals have successful careers in software engineering without a degree, and there are a number of ways to demonstrate your skills and expertise to potential employers, such as through a strong portfolio of relevant projects, strong references, or professional certifications.
