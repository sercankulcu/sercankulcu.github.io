They live in the sewers of New York City and work to protect the city from various villains and threats. April O'Neil is a human ally of the Ninja Turtles, and serves as their primary contact to the outside world. She is a strong and capable young woman, and helps the turtles with various tasks and missions. Splinter is the Ninja Turtles' sensei and adoptive father. He is a mutant rat who was once a pet of the turtles' biological father, Hamato Yoshi. Splinter learned the art of ninjutsu from Yoshi and passed it on to his adopted sons.

In the original 1984 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book, the turtles were each named after Renaissance artists and were each given a specific weapon based on their personalities. Leonardo, the leader of the group, was given a pair of katanas (Japanese swords) as his weapon of choice. Donatello, the team's technician and inventor, was given a bo staff (a long, wooden staff). Raphael, the team's tough guy and rebel, was given a pair of sai (a three-pronged, Asian weapon). Michelangelo, the team's joker and free spirit, was given a pair of nunchucks (a weapon consisting of two sticks connected by a chain).
