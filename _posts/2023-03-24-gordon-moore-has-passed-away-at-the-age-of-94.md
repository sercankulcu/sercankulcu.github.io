Moore is synonymous with innovation, vision, and a groundbreaking idea that would go on to transform the computer industry forever. As the co-founder of Intel Corp., Moore was a central figure in the history of electronics and his contributions to the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips helped launch Silicon Valley and set the stage for the computer to become the ubiquitous , defining tool of modern life.

Moore passed away on March 24, 2023, at his home in Hawaii, at the age of 94, leaving behind an incredible legacy that has touched the lives of millions, if not billions, of people across the world.

In 1965, Moore made a prediction that would fundamentally shape the field of electronics. He foresaw that the number of transistors that could be placed on a microchip would double every year, leading to exponential growth in computing power. Later, he modified the prediction to every two years, but the idea remained the same.

This prophecy, dubbed "Moore's Law," became the standard by which scientists worked over the next few decades to achieve greater computing capacity while reducing costs. Without Moore's vision, the world of computing would look very different today.

Moore's Law led to a revolution in the design and manufacture of computer chips. By placing more and more circuitry onto slivers of silicon, computing power exploded, while the size of computers shrank from room-sized mainframes to handheld devices. Personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other electronic gadgets became ubiquitous, and the digital era was born.

Moore had always been fascinated by electronics, and had a rare talent for combining technological innovation with business acumen. In a 2017 interview, he stated that the partnership with co-founder Robert Noyce, whom he had known since the 1950s, was one of the most important factors in the success of Intel. Together, they created a culture of innovation that propelled their company to prominence, and changed the world in the process.

But Moore was not only a brilliant engineer and entrepreneur; he was also a generous philanthropist. He and his wife, Betty, founded the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in 2000, which today is one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the world. The foundation focuses on science, the environment, and patient care, and has supported groundbreaking research in areas such as astronomy, conservation, and precision medicine.
