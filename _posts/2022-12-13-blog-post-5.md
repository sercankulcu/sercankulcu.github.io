As a student, you are focused on learning and gaining skills, while as a professional, you are applying those skills to real-world projects and responsibilities. 

Main difference between being a student and being a software engineer after graduation
=====

As a student studying software engineering, there are a few things you can do to prepare for your future career:

<b>Focus on your studies:</b> While you are in school, it's important to put your best effort into your coursework and projects. This will not only help you do well academically, but it will also give you the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in your future career as a software engineer.

<b>Gain practical experience:</b> In addition to your classroom studies, consider seeking out opportunities to gain hands-on experience in software development. This could be through internships, co-op programs, or personal projects. This will give you valuable real-world experience and help you build your portfolio.

<b>Network with industry professionals:</b> Attend industry events, join professional organizations, and reach out to people in the field to build your network and learn more about what it's like to work as a software engineer.

After graduation, there are a few key things you can do to kickstart your career as a software engineer:

<b>Look for job opportunities:</b> Start applying for software engineering positions that interest you and align with your skills and goals. Consider reaching out to recruiters or networking with industry professionals to find job openings that may not be advertised publicly.

<b>Keep learning:</b> Even after you graduate, it's important to stay up-to-date with new technologies and trends in the field. Consider taking online courses, attending conferences, or reading industry publications to continue learning and growing as a software engineer.

<b>Build your professional portfolio:</b> As you gain experience in your career, be sure to document your projects and accomplishments in a professional portfolio. This can help you demonstrate your skills and expertise to potential employers and clients.

It's important to continue learning and growing throughout your career, but after graduation, you will have more opportunities to put your skills into practice and build your professional reputation.
