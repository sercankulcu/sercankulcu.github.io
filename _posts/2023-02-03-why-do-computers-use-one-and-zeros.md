* Computers rely on binary, a system of counting using only two digits: 0 and 1.
* Binary is more efficient than tally marks and has an exponential increase in the amount of things it can represent compared to base 10, which uses ten digits.
* Binary is essential to computers because it is based on micro transistors, tiny switches that can be on or off with a weak electrical charge.

What is Binary?:
---

* Binary is a system of counting using only two digits: 0 and 1.
* Binary is based on positional notation, just like base 10, but each digit represents an increasing power of two instead of ten.
* Each digit in binary represents a power of two, starting with 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, and so on.
* Binary is exponentially more efficient than tally marks because adding a new digit doubles the amount of things that can be represented.

Transistors and Binary:
---

* Computers use micro transistors, tiny switches that can be on or off with a weak electrical charge, to perform operations.
* Transistors can be used to represent binary digits: 1 for on and 0 for off.
* Using binary, computers can represent any number between 0 and 255 with one byte, or eight bits.
* A byte is eight bits in a row, and any number between 0 and 255 can be represented with a byte.
* ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a way to convert a computer's data into letters and symbols for humans to work with.

16-Bit Systems:
---

* With only 255 representable values, binary was limiting for computers.
* 16-bit systems, which use two bytes to represent one number, expanded the range of representable numbers from 0 to 65535.
* A 16-bit system doesn't necessarily mean it is exponentially more powerful than an 8-bit system, but it does increase the range of representable numbers.

..

* Binary is an essential concept for computers, allowing them to use transistors to represent information and perform operations.
* With the use of 16-bit systems, computers can represent even more numbers and perform even more complex operations.
* While binary may seem complicated, it is actually a simple and efficient way of counting that has revolutionized the world of computing.
