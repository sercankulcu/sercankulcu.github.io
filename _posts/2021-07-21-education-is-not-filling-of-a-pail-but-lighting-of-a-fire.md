Yeats and Plutarch. Regardless of its origin, the phrase captures an important aspect of education - that it should not be viewed simply as a means of filling a student’s mind with knowledge, but rather as a process of igniting a passion for learning and intellectual curiosity. This perspective encourages educators to inspire creativity and critical thinking, fostering a lifelong love for discovery and growth.

This perspective is supported by research in the field of cognitive psychology, which has shown that an individual's motivation and interest plays a crucial role in their learning and retention of information. When students are engaged and motivated, they are more likely to pay attention, remember what they have learned, and be motivated to seek out additional knowledge on their own.

Furthermore, this view of education aligns with the concept of constructivism, which posits that individuals construct their own understanding of the world through their experiences and interactions with it. When students are provided with opportunities to actively participate in their learning and make connections to their own experiences, they are more likely to construct a deeper and more meaningful understanding of the material.

It is therefore important for educators to strive to create an environment that sparks a love of learning in their students. This can be achieved through a variety of approaches, such as providing authentic and relevant learning experiences, fostering a sense of curiosity and inquiry, and promoting student ownership of their learning.

While, he was right to believe that the goal of education should be to inspire a love of learning, but it is also essential to have a certain degree of knowledge and comprehension. These notes assist to lay that basis and guarantee that you have a fundamental comprehension of important ideas. For instance, you should be prepared to respond to inquiries about technical topics when you are interviewed at high-tech firm. Both the will to study and the foundational knowledge are critical.
