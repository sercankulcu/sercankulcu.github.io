The film is known for its striking imagery and deep symbolism, which are used to tell the story of two childhood friends, Otto and Ana, whose lives become intertwined as they grow older. The film begins with the two main characters as children, and follows them through their teenage years and into adulthood. It tells the story of their love for each other, which is complicated by the fact that they are both in relationships with other people. As the story progresses, the audience is taken on a journey of self-discovery as the characters navigate their complex emotions and relationships.

One of the most striking things about the film is its use of symbolism. Throughout the film, various symbols are used to represent different aspects of the characters' lives and experiences. For example, the paper airplanes represent the fleeting nature of childhood, the red municipal bus represents the constraints of society, and the reindeer represents the wildness of nature. Other symbols in the film include the empty gas gauge, the act of slapping someone, and the Arctic Circle itself.

The film's music is composed by the acclaimed Spanish musician Alberto Iglesias, which adds to the emotional depth of the film. The film's music is mostly instrumental, featuring piano and string instruments, which creates a sense of melancholy that perfectly reflects the characters' feelings.

The film is a powerful exploration of the complexities of love and relationships, and how they are influenced by the constraints of society and the passage of time. It is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that leaves a lasting impression on the audience. The use of symbolism throughout the film adds an extra layer of meaning to the story and helps to create a deeper understanding of the characters and their experiences.
