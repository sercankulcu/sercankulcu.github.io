<img width="150" alt="black-browed black-eyed person" src="/images/posts/a-black-browed-black-eyed-person.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /> Once upon a time, there was a man who I used to hang out with all the time. One day, he turned to me and said, "Why are we always just hanging out and wasting our time?" I thought about it and realized that he was right. From that day on, we stopped just hanging out and wasting our time.

He never knew how to play chess. Well, actually he did know how to play but he would never admit it. He was such a shameless man. He would say that he knew how to play but he didn't, just to avoid playing with me. Oh my goodness, it was so frustrating. He would take hours to make a move and the outcome was always the same. I gave up trying to play with him.

He used to be a great fisherman, especially when it came to catching frog fish. He was the best at it. He would open his arms as wide as he could, then he would crouch down quietly. If he made too much noise, the fish would swim away. He would then slowly dip his hand in the water, keeping it parallel to the surface. When the fish entered his field of view, he would quickly dip his hand in the water and catch the fish. Then he would count the frog fish, usually getting one or two, sometimes even three.

When he was in middle school, he used to smoke cigarettes at home, but he would pour cologne on a metal plate to hide the smell from his mother. Later on, he grew up and his mother would scold him if she caught him smoking at home, so he stopped. But he quit smoking completely and became a disobedient, donkey-like person.

He was a big fan of Sıkı Hakan. He loved his song "Eskici" very much. He would sing "You put shackles on my feet" all the time. His voice used to be beautiful, like a deer's. He was called "The Maradona of the Balkans" in the neighborhood. He is a Beşiktaş fan, but not from the supporter group "Çarşı". He doesn't like to sleep, he reads books, writes poetry and watches documentaries all the time. Sometimes he gets bored and starts to cause trouble. He has a habit of making a noise that sounds like "arkıkı arkıkı" it used to scare me when I was young. He always wears a wool sweater, no matter the weather. I'll write more about him in the future.
