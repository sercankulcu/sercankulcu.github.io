* Computers in the 40s and 50s ran one program at a time
* Programmer would write the program on punch cards and hand it to a computer operator
* The computer operator would feed the programming to the computer when it was next available
* The computer would run the program, output some results, and then wait for the next program
* This process was manual and time-consuming

..

* Operating systems (OSs) were created to help computers operate themselves
* OSs are programs that have special privileges on the hardware and can run and manage other programs
* They are typically the first programs to start when a computer is turned on
* The first OSs were created in the 1950s to handle the mundane manual tasks of loading programs by hand
* Computers could be given batches of programs, and when one was done, the next would start
* This was called batch processing

..

* As computers became more widespread, sharing software became a problem
* Computers had different configurations, and peripherals had to be interfaced with on a low level
* To make it easier for programmers, OSs were implemented as intermediaries between software programs and hardware peripherals
* They provided a software abstraction through APIs called device drivers
* This allowed programmers to talk to common input and output hardware using standardized mechanisms
* OSs also enabled multitasking, allowing multiple programs to be run simultaneously on a single computer
* Each program is allocated its own block of memory

..

* Operating systems are essential for modern computers to function
* They enable multitasking, device driver support, and provide a software abstraction layer for software programs to interact with hardware peripherals
* Without OSs, computers would still be running one program at a time, and sharing software would be very difficult
