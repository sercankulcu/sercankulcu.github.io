Here are popular oil paintings with their respective artists:

* "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo da Vinci

The Mona Lisa is a 16th century portrait painted by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. It is one of the most famous paintings in the world, and its enigmatic smile has made it the subject of numerous theories and speculations. The identity of the woman in the painting is widely believed to be Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of Francesco, a wealthy merchant. The portrait is thought to have been commissioned by Francesco as a gift for Lisa. The Mona Lisa was painted using oil on a poplar panel, and it measures just 30 inches by 21 inches. Despite its small size, the painting has achieved enormous fame and has become an iconic work of art. Over the years, the Mona Lisa has been stolen, vandalized, and copied numerous times. Today, it is housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, where it is one of the most visited artworks in the world.

There are several factors that contribute to the Mona Lisa's enduring fame and significance. One of the main reasons is the painting's technical excellence. The Mona Lisa is a masterful example of Leonardo's skills as a painter, and the subtle, almost imperceptible smile on the woman's face is a testament to his ability to capture the human expression. Another reason for the Mona Lisa's fame is its enduring mystery. Despite extensive research, much about the painting and its subject remains a mystery, and this has fueled countless theories and speculations over the years. Finally, the Mona Lisa's fame can also be attributed to its historical and cultural significance. The painting has become a symbol of the Renaissance and has been the subject of countless articles, books, and other forms of media. Its iconic status has made it one of the most recognizable works of art in the world.

* "The Starry Night" by Vincent van Gogh

"The Starry Night" is an oil painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It was painted in 1889 while van Gogh was a patient at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The painting depicts a view of the village of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence at night, with the stars shining brightly in the sky. The cypress tree in the center of the painting is a prominent feature, and it is surrounded by rolling hills and a small town. 

What makes "The Starry Night" so special is its expressive and emotional quality. Van Gogh's use of vibrant colors and bold brushstrokes gives the painting a sense of movement and energy. The swirling sky and the twisted form of the cypress tree convey a sense of agitation and tension, while the peaceful village below provides a sense of calm and tranquility. In addition to its artistic merit, "The Starry Night" is also significant because it reflects van Gogh's state of mind at the time it was painted. The artist struggled with mental illness throughout his life, and his stay at the asylum was a difficult time for him. The painting is thought to be a reflection of van Gogh's inner turmoil, as well as his desire to find peace and beauty in the world. Today, "The Starry Night" is one of van Gogh's most famous and beloved works, and it is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Post-Impressionist art. It is housed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

* "The Persistence of Memory" by Salvador Dali

"The Persistence of Memory" is a surrealist painting by the Spanish artist Salvador Dalí. It was painted in 1931 and has become one of the artist's most famous works. The painting depicts a desert landscape, with several strange objects scattered across the scene. The most notable of these are the melting clocks, which are rendered in a way that suggests the passage of time. 

What makes "The Persistence of Memory" so special is its bizarre and dreamlike quality. The melting clocks are a metaphor for the concept of time, and the way they are depicted suggests that time is fluid and constantly changing. The other objects in the painting, such as the ants and the limp watches, add to the surreal atmosphere and contribute to the overall sense of disorientation. In addition to its artistic merit, "The Persistence of Memory" is also significant because it reflects the ideas and themes that were central to the surrealist movement. Surrealism was an artistic and literary movement that sought to tap into the unconscious mind and explore the irrational and surreal aspects of reality. "The Persistence of Memory" is a perfect example of this, as it presents a world that is both familiar and strange at the same time. Today, "The Persistence of Memory" is one of the most famous and influential works of surrealist art, and it is widely considered a masterpiece. It is housed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

* "The Last Supper" by Leonardo da Vinci

"The Last Supper" is a painting by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, created between 1495 and 1498.

The painting is a mural, and it covers the back wall of the dining hall in the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It is a large painting, measuring approximately 15 feet by 29 feet. 

What makes "The Last Supper" so special is its historical and cultural significance. It is one of the most famous works of art in the world and has become an iconic representation of the last meal shared by Jesus and his apostles. It has also been the subject of numerous books, films, and other forms of media, and it is widely considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art. In terms of its artistic merit, "The Last Supper" is notable for its attention to detail and its use of perspective. Leonardo was a master of anatomy and was able to create highly realistic figures, and this is evident in the painting's depiction of the apostles. The use of perspective also adds depth and realism to the scene, making it seem as though the viewer is a part of the action. Despite its fame, "The Last Supper" has also been the subject of much controversy and debate. Over the years, it has suffered from numerous restoration efforts and has been damaged by a variety of factors, including water, pollution, and the passage of time. Despite these challenges, it remains a revered and beloved work of art.

* "The Scream" by Edvard Munch

"The Scream" is a series of four paintings and several prints by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. It was created between 1893 and 1910, and it has become one of the most famous works of art in the world. The painting depicts a figure standing on a rocky ledge, with a turbulent sea and a red sky in the background. The figure's face is contorted in a scream, and its hands are pressed against its ears.

What makes "The Scream" so special is its expressive and emotional quality. Munch's use of vibrant colors and bold brushstrokes gives the painting a sense of movement and energy, and the figure's anguished expression conveys a sense of terror and despair. In addition to its artistic merit, "The Scream" is also significant because it reflects the ideas and themes that were central to the expressionist movement. Expressionism was an artistic movement that sought to express inner emotional states through art, and "The Scream" is a perfect example of this. The painting is thought to be a reflection of Munch's own feelings of anxiety and despair, as well as the anxieties of the modern world.
