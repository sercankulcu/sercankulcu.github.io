The culmination of an arduous journey was marked by the completion of my doctoral studies, a milestone achieved through relentless dedication. However, amidst personal triumphs, our lives were overshadowed by profound sorrow as we bid farewell to my wife's mother, experiencing the profound grief that comes with loss. "What goes away does not come back." This simple yet profound observation encapsulates the inevitability of change and the irreversible nature of certain experiences.

In the realm of the unexpected, my car experienced its first breakdown on the road, leaving me stranded for the first time. This episode served as a reminder of life's unpredictability and the resilience required to navigate unforeseen challenges.

In essence, 2022 was a year of growth, both personal and intellectual, marked by triumphs, losses, and the invaluable lessons that come with living a full and varied life. As I reflect on the highs and lows of the past year, I carry forward the wisdom gained, ready to embrace the unknowns that lie ahead.
